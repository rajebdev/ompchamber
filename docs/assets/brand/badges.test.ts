/**
 * The README's badge row carries three logos that shields.io cannot resolve
 * itself, so each is inlined as a base64 data URI in the badge URL. That makes
 * the README and `docs/assets/brand/*.svg` two copies of the same bytes, and
 * nothing in the build reads either one — a badge whose payload has drifted
 * from its source renders an old mark forever, with no error anywhere.
 *
 * Three failure modes are pinned here, each of which was real while this was
 * being written:
 *
 * - **Drift.** The URL is regenerated from the file, so a mark edited without
 *   re-embedding its payload fails rather than silently shipping the old one.
 * - **Encoding.** `+` is decoded as a space by a query parser and a raw `/`
 *   ends the path segment, so both — plus `=` padding — must be
 *   percent-encoded. Verified against shields: an unencoded `+` in the payload
 *   made the badge drop the logo entirely, answering 200 with no `<image>`.
 * - **shields cannot do it any other way.** There is no Simple Icons slug for
 *   Elysia or Shiki (checked against the full slug list) and `logo=<url>` is
 *   rejected, so a future edit cannot "simplify" these to a named logo.
