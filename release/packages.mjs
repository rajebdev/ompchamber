/**
 * The semantic-release configuration for one published package.
 *
 * The packages are released from the SAME repository and the same history as
 * the app, so everything here is about narrowing a commit range down to the
 * commits that belong to one package — the version rules, the changelog shape
 * and the contributor credit are the app's, reused rather than restated.
 *
 * Three mechanisms do the narrowing, and all three are needed:
 *
 * 1. **A per-package `tagFormat`.** `plugin-sdk/v${version}` makes
 *    `release/commits.js` range the commits since that package's own last tag,
 *    so a release is decided from what changed since it was last published.
 * 2. **A path filter in front of the analyzer and the notes generator.** A tag
 *    range still contains every app commit made in between, and a `feat` in one
 *    of those would bump the package's minor version while its own code did not
 *    change at all. The filter keeps only commits that touched the package
 *    directory, which is the same rule a maintainer applies by hand.
 * 3. **A local version plugin** (`release/version-package.mjs`) writes the new
 *    version into the package's own `package.json`. `@semantic-release/npm`
 *    cannot do it here: it shells out to `npm version`, and npm does not support
 *    the `workspace:` protocol this workspace declares. The plugin's file header
 *    carries the measurement.
 *
 * The filter is applied by WRAPPING the analyzer and the notes generator rather
 * than by using a shareable config: `context.commits` is what both read, and
 * semantic-release hands the same context to every plugin in a step, so the
 * only place a subset can be introduced is inside the plugin call.
