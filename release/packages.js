/**
 * The published packages, in the one place their release identities live.
 *
 * `release/packages.mjs` reads this table, `release/release-packages.mjs` reads
 * it, and `release/packages.test.js` asserts it against the tree — so a
 * directory, a tag prefix or a manifest name can only be stated here. A second
 * copy is how a package gets released under the wrong tag, which publishes a
 * version nobody asked for and cannot be undone.
 *
 * `name` is duplicated from the package's own manifest on purpose: the tag
 * prefix and the manifest name are two facts that must agree, and
 * `packages.test.js` is what holds them together. Reading the manifest here
 * would make the agreement untestable.
 *
 * **Order is load-bearing.** `@ompchamber/ui` declares
 * `"@ompchamber/plugin-sdk": "workspace:*"`, which Bun rewrites to an exact
 * version at publish time from the version `bun.lock` records for the workspace
 * package — not from the manifest on disk. So a `ui` release pins whatever SDK
 * version the lock says, which is why the version plugin refreshes the lock and
 * why `release-packages.mjs` releases in this order and stops on the first
 * failure: a `ui` release must never follow a failed SDK release, or it
 * publishes a package whose dependency is not the one it was built against.
