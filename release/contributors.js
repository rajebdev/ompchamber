/**
 * Contributor credit for the release notes the pipeline generates.
 *
 * The notes generator hands every commit a git identity — `author.name` and
 * `author.email` — and nothing else, so the handle a changelog wants (the
 * GitHub login) has to be resolved from it:
 *
 * - A `NNN+login@users.noreply.github.com` address carries the login verbatim.
 *   It covers everything committed through the web UI or with GitHub's "keep my
 *   email private" setting, and it costs no request.
 * - Every other address is a real mailbox, and only the API can say which
 *   account it belongs to: `GET /repos/{owner}/{repo}/commits/{sha}` reports the
 *   author GitHub attributed that commit to, and returns `null` when the address
 *   is not verified on any account. It needs a token, so without one the credit
 *   is simply skipped.
 *
 * Resolution is best-effort by design: a missing token, a failed request, an
 * unattributed commit or a bot leaves the bullet as it was, because a release
 * must not fail over a courtesy line. The repository owner is never credited —
 * the maintainer's own commits are the bulk of most releases, and crediting them
 * is noise the changelog does not need.
 *
 * Results are memoized per email: one author who lands ten commits costs one
 * lookup, which is also what keeps a release well inside the API rate limit.
