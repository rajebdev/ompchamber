/**
 * Cut a release for every published package that has changes.
 *
 * Run by the `packages` job of `.github/workflows/release.yml` on a push to
 * `main`, BEFORE that workflow's `app` job — the app's published
 * `@ompchamber/*` pins come from `bun.lock`, so the packages must be versioned
 * and the lock committed before the app releases.
 *
 * Each package is released from the SAME commit range and the same rules as the
 * app (see `release/packages.mjs` for the per-package config, which narrows the
 * range to the package's own commits). Releases run in catalog order and stop
 * on the first failure, because `@ompchamber/ui` pins the SDK version at pack
 * time: publishing a `ui` whose SDK dependency is not on npm is worse than
 * publishing neither.
 *
 * **The tags this creates do NOT trigger `publish-plugins.yml`.** A push made
 * with `GITHUB_TOKEN` raises no workflow run (only `workflow_dispatch` and
 * `repository_dispatch` are exempt — see "Triggering a workflow" in the Actions
 * docs), which is the same reason `release.yml` dispatches `publish.yml`
 * itself. This script therefore only cuts the release; the workflow dispatches
 * the publish afterwards, for the packages it names in its `released` output.
 *
 * usage: node release/release-packages.mjs [--dry-run]
