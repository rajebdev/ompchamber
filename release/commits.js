/**
 * Reading the commit range a package release is decided from.
 *
 * semantic-release hands each plugin the commits it collected, but nothing in
 * that list says which FILES a commit touched — `git-log-parser` reads a fixed
 * field set (hash, author, committer, subject, body) and no path. A package
 * release needs the paths, because the rule that keeps an app commit from
 * bumping the SDK's version is "did this commit touch the SDK's directory".
 *
 * Two `git` calls, both whole-range rather than per commit:
 *
 * 1. `git log` once for the range, with a record separator no commit message
 *    contains. The subject/body fields come from git itself rather than from a
 *    second parser, and `author`/`committer` are both set to the author: the
 *    credit clause reads the author, and the committer of a rebase is not who
 *    wrote the change.
 * 2. `git diff-tree --stdin` once for every hash, which prints one hash line
 *    followed by the paths that commit changed. Measured against `git log
 *    --name-only` on the same range: identical paths, and `--stdin` accepts all
 *    hashes in a single process instead of one `git log` per commit.
 *
 * `--root` is what makes the repository's first commit list its paths at all —
 * without it git treats it as having no parent to diff against and prints
 * nothing, so a package created in that commit would look untouched.
