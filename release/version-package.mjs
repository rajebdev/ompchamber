/**
 * The version write for a published package.
 *
 * `@semantic-release/npm` is the usual plugin for this and cannot be used here:
 * it writes the version by shelling out to `npm version`, and npm does not
 * support the `workspace:` protocol that `packages/ui` declares its SDK
 * dependency with. Running it inside this workspace root fails outright —
 * measured on npm 11 in a rehearsal of the real pipeline:
 *
 *     npm error code EUNSUPPORTEDPROTOCOL
 *     npm error Unsupported URL Type "workspace:": workspace:*
 *
 * npm reifies the whole workspace tree to run `version`, so the failure is on a
 * sibling package's manifest and has nothing to do with the one being released.
 * (It also removed `node_modules` outright in the first rehearsal.)
 *
 * What is left of the plugin's job here is one field, because this pipeline
 * never publishes: `publish-plugins.yml` does, with `bun publish`, which packs
 * the workspace protocol correctly (verified: the published tarball carries the
 * exact SDK version, not `workspace:*`). So the version is written directly,
 * with no package manager in the loop.
 *
 * The manifest is re-serialized with the same two-space indent and trailing
 * newline the files already use, and `JSON.parse` preserves key order, so a
 * release commit's diff is the version line alone.

 * `bun.lock` records a version for every workspace package, and `bun publish`
 * substitutes a `workspace:` spec from THAT record rather than from the
 * manifest on disk. So bumping a package's version and packing a dependent
 * package in the same run publishes the dependency at its PREVIOUS version:
 * measured, `@ompchamber/ui@2.0.0` went to npm declaring
 * `"@ompchamber/plugin-sdk": "1.0.0"` while the SDK was 2.0.0 on the registry —
 * an install that resolves the old SDK, which is exactly the incompatibility
 * the 2.0.0 release existed to announce.
 *
 * Reproduced in isolation: bump `packages/a/package.json` to 2.0.0 without
 * running `bun install`, and `bun pm pack` in `packages/b` (which depends on
 * `a` at `workspace:*`) still writes `"a": "1.0.0"`.
 *
 * `--lockfile-only` is deliberate: the release job has already installed, and
 * the only thing that needs to change is the lock's record of the version, so
 * `node_modules` is left alone.
