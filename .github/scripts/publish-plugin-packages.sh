# Publishes the @ompchamber/* plugin packages to npm.
#
# Publishing is IDEMPOTENT, and that is the whole point of this script rather
# than a bare `bun publish` in the workflow. A run can die between the first
# package and the second (a network blip, a token that expires mid-job, a
# cancelled job), and the retry must finish the job rather than fail on the
# package that already went out. So each package is checked against the registry
# first, and one that is already published at this exact version is skipped.
#
# A version already on npm is never overwritten: npm refuses a republish, and
# republishing would be wrong anyway. To ship a change, bump the version.

# usage: publish-plugin-packages.sh <package-dir>...
#   each <package-dir> is relative to the repo root and holds a package.json
