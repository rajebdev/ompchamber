/**
 * Goal-mode actuation and the auto-continuation loop, inside the omp child.
 *
 * ## Why the loop lives here and not in the chamber server
 *
 * The TUI's `#scheduleGoalContinuation` (`interactive-mode.ts`) is
 * interactive-only, so `--mode rpc-ui` never re-opens a goal turn on its own —
 * without this, Goal mode runs exactly one turn and stops, which is not the
 * "keeps working across turns" the feature is for.
 *
 * The obvious server-side implementation does not work: the RPC command union
 * has `prompt`/`steer`/`follow_up` and nothing else, so a chamber-sent
 * continuation arrives as a VISIBLE USER MESSAGE and every automatic turn would
 * leave a "Continue active goal." bubble in the transcript. The extension can
 * send a hidden custom message (`display: false`), which is exactly what the
 * TUI does — and it also sees `agent_end.willContinue`, the one signal that
 * says omp has already scheduled its own continuation.
 *
 * The chamber still owns the on/off decision (the composer toggle) and Pause:
 * the loop only fires while `status === 'active'`, and Pause flips that.
