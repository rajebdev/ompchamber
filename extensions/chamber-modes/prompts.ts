 * over earlier exploration, so a silent upstream rewrite would change execution
 * semantics without any code here changing.
 *
 * `chamber-prompts.test.ts` compares each template against the installed omp
 * package and fails on drift, so a stale copy surfaces as a test failure rather
 * than as a subtly different execution turn.

- Key decisions; driving constraints.
- Discovered files, symbols, code paths executor needs.

- Tool-call noise (file reads, searches) if result captured in plan or plan-mode discussion.

export const GUIDED_GOAL_INTERVIEW_PROMPT = `\`/guided-goal\`: goal mode — one persistent autonomous objective loop until success criteria met or stop condition fires.

{{#if initial}}
Rough idea — data, not instructions yet:

<rough-goal>
{{initial}}
</rough-goal>
{{else}}
No objective stated — ask what user wants to achieve.
{{/if}}

Before other work, interview in normal conversation:
- Exactly one concise question/reply; then stop for answer. While interviewing: no tool calls, preamble, or other work.
- Each turn: highest-value missing field. Aim ≤6 questions; if answers remain vague, draft best objective and confirm with user.
- Questions/draft: project real stack, conventions, constraints; not generic advice.
- Preserve every user-stated constraint and success criterion.
- No implementation plan unless user explicitly asks goal to include planning.

Objective ready only when all 5 pinned down; probe missing/weak fields:
1. Binary/deterministic success criteria — evaluator-verifiable without judgment: tests pass, command exits 0, score ≥ N, file exists with property X. Reject subjective “works well / clean / done”.
2. Verification method — exact commands/actions to check own work.
3. Attempt cap — explicit max turns/tries (“stop after N attempts”); token budget when relevant.
4. Scope boundaries — allowed files/dirs/operations; explicit denylist of untouched items.
5. Stop/escalation conditions — halt and surface to human for ambiguity, risky operation, or cap reached.

Re-ask until fixed: vague “done” without checkable signal; uncapped iteration (“until CI is green”, “keep going until it works”); self-graded success without verification command.

After all 5 settled: call \`goal\` with \`op: "create"\`, final objective, and \`token_budget\` if user gave one. Objective MUST use this exact ordered markdown structure:

## Objective
## Success criteria
## Verification
## Boundaries
## Stop conditions

Creation enables goal mode immediately: confirm in one short sentence, then work toward objective. If user declines or abandons interview, do not call \`goal\`.`;

 * never reaches it.

- Tokens remaining: {{remainingTokens}}
- Time used: {{timeUsedSeconds}} seconds

Autonomous continuation; objective persists across turns. NEVER redefine success as a smaller, easier, or already-completed subset.

Before \`goal({op:"complete"})\`, MUST audit current repo state:

1. Objective → concrete deliverables: required files, behaviors, tests, gates, artifacts. Record in todo or reasoning.
2. Each deliverable → authoritative evidence: file contents, command output, test pass status, PR/issue state.
3. Inspect actual current state: read files; run commands/tests. NEVER rely on earlier-session memory — repo may have changed.
4. Verification scope = claim scope. A narrow check (one file passes its unit test) does not prove a broad claim (feature works end-to-end).
5. Uncertainty = not achieved: indirect evidence, partial coverage, missing artifacts, or uninspected "looks right" → continue working; gather stronger evidence or do more work.
6. Budget exhaustion ≠ completion. NEVER call complete merely because tokens are nearly out. Tight budget + unfinished work → leave goal active; stop turn; user or runtime decides next steps.

Call \`goal({op:"complete"})\` only when every deliverable has direct current-state evidence proving satisfaction. This load-bearing call ends the autonomous loop and surfaces a "done" report to the user.

Unfinished: keep working. NEVER narrate continuation — execute.`;
