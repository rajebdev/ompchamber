/**
 * Plan- and Goal-mode actuation for the chamber, running INSIDE the omp child.
 *
 * Why an extension: omp exposes neither mode over RPC. `RpcCommand` has no
 * plan/goal verb, `/plan` and `/goal` are `handleTui`-only (a prompt carrying
 * one reaches the model as literal text — measured), `mode_change` entries are
 * not restored under `--mode rpc-ui`, and `plan.defaultOnStartup` is read by
 * `interactive-mode.ts` alone. The extension API is the one surface that
 * reaches the live `AgentSession`, so the chamber ships this file and the spawn
 * path passes it with `-e <abs path>`.
 *
 * Why `-e` and not `~/.omp/agent/extensions/`: the chamber owns this file. An
 * install there would mutate the user's config, could be disabled from the
 * Settings → Extensions list, and would leave a stale copy behind on upgrade.
 * An explicit `-e` is also still honoured under `--no-extensions`.
 *
 * Control surface: one command, `/chamber-mode <scope> <action> [json]`,
 * dispatched by the chamber as an ordinary prompt. Measured: the command runs
 * locally, answers `agentInvoked: false`, and writes NO user message to the
 * transcript — so the mode controls never appear as conversation.
 *
 * Every outcome is reported through a notice MARKER (`CHAMBER_*_MARKER`), which
 * is how the chamber learns the new state without polling: the frames reach it
 * over the same event stream the transcript uses.
