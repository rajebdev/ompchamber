/**
 * The parked `xd://propose`: the slot it lives in, the plan body it carries,
 * and the ways it can be released.
 *
 * Split from `plan.ts` so the review surface owns only the DECISION (which of
 * omp's five choices, and what each one does to the session). This half knows
 * nothing about choices — it is the state a decision is made against.
 *
 * ## The parking contract
 *
 * Plan mode's approval path is a `write` to `xd://propose`, which omp dispatches
 * to whatever `setPlanProposalHandler` installed. The TUI's handler opens the
 * full-screen review overlay and resolves when the operator picks; the model's
 * tool call stays open the whole time. That is exactly what the chamber needs —
 * the operator reviews in the web console, and the decision travels back — so
 * the handler parks the promise the same way.
 *
 * Parking is safe: measured on omp 18.4.4 with a proposal held for 45 s, the RPC
 * loop stays responsive (`get_state` answers, a second command runs) because the
 * handler blocks only the tool call, not the reader.
 *
 * ## Why it waits INDEFINITELY
 *
 * The review has no deadline, exactly like the `ask` tool: `ask.timeout`
 * defaults to 0 — "wait forever" — because a question that expires under the
 * operator is worse than one that waits. A plan review is the same kind of
 * gate, and this used to be the exception: a 30-minute timer resolved the
 * proposal as a REFINEMENT, which kept plan mode active and told the model to
 * plan again. So an operator who left a review open over lunch came back to a
 * different plan, with no notice that theirs had been discarded, while the panel
 * still showed the plan the child had already abandoned. omp itself has no such
 * timer (`peekPlanProposalHandler` is awaited with no deadline), so the chamber
 * was inventing one.
 *
 * What keeps a parked proposal from becoming a hung run is therefore an
 * EXPLICIT exit, not a clock:
 *
 *  - the operator decides (five choices, or Dismiss, which refines);
 *  - `plan off` releases it as a refinement before tearing plan mode down, so
 *    turning the toggle off mid-review cannot strand the turn;
 *  - Stop/abort ends the turn the tool call belongs to — the same escape an
 *    unanswered `ask` has;
 *  - switching sessions or reloading does NOT touch it: the child keeps the call
 *    open and the review is re-published to whichever client attaches.
