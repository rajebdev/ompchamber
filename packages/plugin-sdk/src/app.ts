/**
 * The app-side contract: what a plugin's bundle exports and what the host
 * provides it at runtime.
 *
 * A plugin ships ONE ESM bundle (`dist/app.js`) that the host `import()`s into
 * the page. Its default export is a {@link PluginAppDefinition} built by
 * {@link definePluginApp}; calling `setup(app)` registers components into named
 * slots, and the host renders those components IN ITS OWN TREE — the same
 * Preact instance, the same document, the same theme. There is no iframe and no
 * message channel: a plugin is local code, trusted the way a VS Code extension
 * is trusted.
 *
 * This file is TYPES ONLY apart from `definePluginApp`, and that is what makes
 * it safe to bundle into every plugin: the runtime half (`preact`, `preact/hooks`,
 * `preact/jsx-runtime`, `@ompchamber/ui`, and the host hooks) is NOT bundled —
 * the build marks those specifiers external and the host answers them from
 * `globalThis.__ompchamberPluginRuntime`. One Preact for the host and every
 * plugin is what keeps hooks working; two copies produce the
 * `Cannot read properties of undefined (reading '__H')` failure.
