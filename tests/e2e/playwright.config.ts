/**
 * Browser E2E config.
 *
 * The runner is Playwright's own, deliberately not `bun test`: a browser spec
 * needs a per-file browser context, a per-file server, and a trace artifact on
 * failure — a lifecycle the Bun runner does not own, and one that would fight
 * `bun test`'s single-process, shared-`globalThis` model (the reason
 * `test-support/isolated-db.ts` exists at all).
 *
 * Every project boots its OWN server from a temp root, so two projects never
 * share a database. `mock` and `real` are separate projects because they are
 * separate data modes: `mock` runs on the seeded demo presets and needs no
 * `omp` install, while `real` drives a scripted fake child through the real
 * spawn path. A spec names the mode it needs in its fixture call.
 *
 * `trace: 'on-first-retry'` plus a screenshot on failure is the evidence
 * CONTRIBUTING.md §2 asks a UI change to carry, produced by the run itself
 * rather than by hand.
