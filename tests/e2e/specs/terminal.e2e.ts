/**
 * The terminal panel opens a REAL pseudo-terminal.
 *
 * This is the only spec that proves the PTY path end to end: the browser dials
 * the terminal WebSocket, the server spawns a shell on a `Bun.Terminal`, the
 * bytes the shell writes come back as binary frames, and xterm consumes them.
 * Everything below the socket — the registry, the scrollback replay, the resize
 * signal — is covered by unit tests against the runtime; what a unit test cannot
 * show is that a person typing in a browser reaches a real shell and reads its
 * answer.
 *
 * The assertion reads the terminal WebSocket's own FRAMES, not the DOM. xterm
 * paints through a WebGL canvas (`.xterm-rows` is empty by design), so there is
 * no text node to query, and scraping a canvas would test the renderer rather
 * than the transport. The frames are the contract: bytes out on a keystroke,
 * the shell's answer back on the same socket.
