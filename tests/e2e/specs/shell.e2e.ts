/**
 * The shell boots and the app renders.
 *
 * This is the smoke spec every other spec depends on: if the server does not
 * start, the client bundle does not build, or hydration throws, nothing below
 * this layer can tell you why — the failures surface as "element not found"
 * three specs later. Pinning it here means a broken bundle reports itself as a
 * broken bundle.
 *
 * The two assertions that matter are the ones a unit test cannot make: the
 * document is served by the real server (SSR shell + client bundle through
 * Bun's own asset routes), and hydration produces a mounted app tree with no
 * console error. `app-root` is the one `data-testid` this layer needs — it is
 * a container to scope every later query, not a name the UI already carries.
