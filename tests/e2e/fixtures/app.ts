/**
 * The Playwright fixture every spec's `test` is imported from.
 *
 * Its one job is lifecycle: a spec asks for a mode, and it gets a browser
 * context pointed at a chamber server that was started fresh for it and is
 * torn down when the spec ends — including on failure, so a failing spec still
 * removes its temp root and its child process. Nothing is shared between
 * specs, which is what keeps the assertions honest: a test that mutated a
 * setting cannot leak it into the next one.
 *
 * Two facts are injected rather than computed here. The repo root comes from
 * `import.meta.dirname` (this file lives at `tests/e2e/fixtures/`), so the
 * server always runs against THIS checkout. The mode comes from the spec, and
 * the fixture starts the matching server on demand — a mock spec never pays
 * for a fake `omp`, and a real spec gets one without the other spec's mode
 * leaking in.
