/**
 * semantic-release configuration — driven by `.github/workflows/release.yml` on
 * every push to `main`.
 *
 * The pipeline keeps the two promises `CHANGELOG.md` already made by hand: the
 * version comes from Conventional Commits (`feat` -> minor, `!` / `BREAKING
 * CHANGE` -> breaking, anything else -> patch), and each released section keeps
 * its shape — `## [x.y.z] — YYYY-MM-DD` over the Added / Changed / Fixed /
 * Removed categories, newest first, under an untouched intro block.
 *
 * A bullet credits the contributor who wrote it, unless that contributor is the
 * repository owner: `release/contributors.js` reads GitHub's privacy addresses
 * (`NNN+login@users.noreply.github.com`) directly and asks the API about every
 * other author — the job's `GITHUB_TOKEN` is what makes that second path work,
 * so a rehearsal without one credits privacy addresses alone.
 *
 * Two pins here are load-bearing:
 *
 * - `conventional-changelog-conventionalcommits@9` is the last preset written for
 *   `conventional-changelog-writer@8`, which is what
 *   `@semantic-release/release-notes-generator@14` (the one semantic-release 25
 *   installs) resolves. Preset 10 targets writer 9, and against writer 8 it
 *   renders its own "requires writer@9" guard message instead of release notes.
 * - `@semantic-release/npm` writes the release version into `package.json` via
 *   `npm version`, so the job running this config needs Node and its npm on PATH
 *   (`actions/setup-node`) — Bun alone is not enough. Publishing stays out of
 *   this pipeline: `npmPublish: false` and `.github/workflows/publish.yml` owns
 *   the npm side.
 *
 * Rehearsing a release locally is not just `--dry-run`: see the note at the top of
 * `.github/workflows/release.yml`, which is where the isolated recipe lives — and
 * where the reason `origin` alone does not contain it is written down.
