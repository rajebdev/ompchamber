/**
 * A database of one test file's own.
 *
 * The handle is a PROCESS-wide singleton (`globalThis.__ompChamberDb`), and
 * `OMPCHAMBER_DB_PATH` is read only while that handle is being opened. A suite
 * that sets the path inside a test therefore gets the handle an EARLIER file
 * already opened — which is the real `~/.ompchamber/db.sqlite` whenever that
 * file did not isolate itself. The writes then land in the developer's own
 * database, which is how a panel-scan suite silently rewrote a live install's
 * `omp_panel_plugins` row.
 *
 * So the two steps are one call and their ORDER is the point: close and clear
 * the existing handle FIRST, then point the path at a temp file — a path set
 * while the old handle is still cached is never consulted.
