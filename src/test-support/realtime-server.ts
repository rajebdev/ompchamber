/**
 * Test seam for the unified realtime channel.
 *
 * The hub is server-authoritative and its whole job is producing frames, so a
 * test of a panel's realtime behaviour needs a SERVER, not a stubbed socket:
 * stubbing `WebSocket` would test the fake's frame timing rather than the
 * delivery contract. This starts a real Elysia listener serving the real route
 * over real topic resolvers, and the code under test dials it through the real
 * client — the same approach `agent/ws.test.ts` takes, and for the same reason:
 * the bugs worth pinning live in the framework's callback identity and the
 * hub's ordering, which a fake cannot reproduce.
 *
 * Waiting is done on the CLIENT's own notifications (`waitForTopic`), never on
 * a duration and never on a second observer socket: an observer socket would
 * prove the server sent a frame, not that the code under test processed it.
 *
 * One harness per test FILE: the hub, its topics and the listener are process
 * state, so a file that installs a different topic set owns the harness for its
 * whole run.
