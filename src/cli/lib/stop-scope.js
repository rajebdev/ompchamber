// Ownership scope for `ompchamber stop`.

// Kept separate from the command so the rule is testable without a live
// server: the default scope is the instances the CLI started, and only an
// explicit `--port <port>` / `--all` widens it to the ones it did not. That
// distinction is the whole reason this module exists — a server running from
// source sits under a launcher that exits with its child, so stopping it by
// default takes a `bun run dev` loop down with it.
