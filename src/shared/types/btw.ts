 * A BTW topic is an independent question plus its explicit follow-ups, run
 * against the parent session's context but never appended to its transcript —
 * the same contract omp's own `/btw` implements in the TUI. The server is the
 * source of truth for a session's topics: each turn's conversation arrives as
 * `btw_message` frames in the chat's own `ChatMessageData` shape, and the
 * running turn is also carried in `BtwState.live` so a client attaching
 * mid-turn renders the answer already produced.
 *
 * A side question runs WITHOUT tools and on the CHAT's model and thinking
 * selector, so there is no per-topic model/access picker and no approval dialog
 * to answer — the panel's composer is an input and a send button, exactly like
 * the TUI's.
