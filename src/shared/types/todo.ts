/**
 * oh-my-pi's `todo` tool state, as the chamber reads it.
 *
 * omp owns this list, not the chamber: the `todo` tool writes a structured
 * snapshot into the session JSONL (a `toolResult` entry's `details.phases`, or
 * a `user_todo_edit` custom entry when the operator edits the list by hand), and
 * every later branch rehydration — resume, rewind, fork, `/btw` — reads the
 * DEEPEST such snapshot on the active branch back out of it
 * (`getLatestTodoPhasesFromEntries`). The chamber mirrors exactly that read, so
 * the panel and the agent's own HUD cannot disagree about what is open.
 *
 * The status vocabulary is omp's, including the two states the chamber's chat
 * timeline never rendered before: `blocked` (waiting on something, with an
 * optional note) and `abandoned` (deliberately dropped). Both are settled-but-
 * not-done, which is why `isClosedTodo` — not `status === 'completed'` — is
 * what any progress counter must use.
