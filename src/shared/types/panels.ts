/**
 * Panel-plugin contribution types.
 *
 * A panel plugin is third-party code the chamber loads INTO ITS OWN PAGE: the
 * bundle is a real ESM module, the host `import()`s it, and the components it
 * registers are rendered in the host's Preact tree — the same document, the
 * same theme, the same hooks. There is no iframe and no message channel, so a
 * plugin is local code, trusted the way a VS Code extension is trusted.
 *
 * The manifest therefore carries only what the host needs BEFORE the code runs:
 * an identity, an optional icon, and the bundle to import. Which panels exist,
 * their titles and their positions are decided by the registrations the bundle
 * makes when it loads.
