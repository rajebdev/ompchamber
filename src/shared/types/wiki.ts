 * the way a reader would — the wiki's own git history — and never needs a
 * provider token, an API version, or a per-host code path. That one fact is why
 * a single implementation covers github.com, gitlab.com and a self-hosted
 * GitLab (`git-rbi.jatismobile.com`): the URL shape is the same on all three.
 *
 * The provider name below is therefore a LABEL for the reader (it picks the web
 * URL of a page and the badge in the header), never a branch in the fetch.
