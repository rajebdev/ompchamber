 * announces itself while the current one never interrupts a second time. A
 * permanent boolean would make the feature self-destruct after the first update
 * it ever offered, and a per-page-load flag would re-announce the same version
 * on every reload — which is what the user sees, so the durable copy is what
 * matters.
 *
 * The store is `app_settings` through the shared settings client, deliberately:
 * this repository has no localStorage (SQLite is the single source of truth, see
 * `@/shared/lib/settings/client`), and the marker is per INSTALL, not per session
 * — so it does not belong in `session_ui_state` beside a session's layout.
