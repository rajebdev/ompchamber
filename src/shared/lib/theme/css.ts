/**
 * The `[data-theme]` CSS for every palette in the catalog, as one string.
 *
 * Generated rather than hand-written because the palette values already exist
 * in TypeScript — the appearance cards render the same eight colors as chips —
 * so a second hand-maintained copy in `tailwind.css` would be 45 blocks that
 * drift from the cards the moment either side is edited.
 *
 * Two details are load-bearing:
 *
 * - **Selector specificity is `html[data-theme=…]`, not `[data-theme=…]`.**
 *   `tailwind.css` carries the default palette on `:root`, which is also
 *   (0,1,0); at equal specificity the later declaration wins by document order,
 *   so a bare attribute selector injected before the stylesheet would lose and
 *   every theme would render as `paper`.
 * - **`color-scheme` is set per variant.** Scrollbars, form controls and the
 *   browser's own canvas background are painted by the UA from it; without it a
 *   dark theme keeps white scrollbars and a white overscroll area.
 *
 * No DOM here — the SSR shell inlines this, and the client injects the same
 * string only when a served document predates it.
