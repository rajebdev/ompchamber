/**
 * WHY: everything the composer sends is rewritten before it reaches omp, so a
 * translation bug silently corrupts the user's prompt. `@file:` tokens are
 * rewritten to omp's native file-mention syntax, and `@agent` tokens are
 * stripped from the body and replaced by a delegation header. The edge cases
 * that matter are the ones that decide whether a token is a mention at all:
 * quoted paths with spaces, trailing prose punctuation, a bare path that must
 * NOT be swallowed as an agent name, and a draft that is nothing but mentions.
