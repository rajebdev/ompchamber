/**
 * Slash commands oh-my-pi implements only for its own TUI.
 *
 * omp's registry carries a `handle` (text/ACP mode) for 42 of its 82 builtins
 * and `handleTui` alone for the other 40. `executeAcpBuiltinSlashCommand`
 * requires `handle`, and `buildAvailableSlashCommands` skips entries without
 * one — which is why none of these names appear in the composer popup.
 *
 * The popup is not the whole surface: a name can still be typed, pasted from
 * the docs, or arrive through the follow-up queue. RPC forwards such a prompt
 * to `session.prompt()` verbatim, where the only slash handling left is file
 * commands and prompt templates — so `/plan` reaches the MODEL as literal text
 * and it improvises a turn around it. Measured on omp 18.3.5: `/hotkeys`
 * started a run whose transcript opened with the raw string, the model read
 * `omp://slash-command-internals.md` and ran bash and grep to work out what it
 * meant. `/clear` cleared nothing, `/new` opened nothing, `/login` logged in
 * nothing. The TUI answers all of these instantly and locally.
 *
 * The table is data extracted from the installed omp's own registry, so a name
 * omp moves to text mode stops being guarded by deleting its row. It is
 * deliberately keyed on NAMES ONLY: the guard must not depend on the version of
 * the running child, because a chamber talking to an older omp would otherwise
 * refuse a command that build actually implements.
 *
 * `plan` and `goal` are absent because the CHAMBER now owns them: the composer's
 * mode toggles send `/chamber-mode …` to a chamber-owned extension inside the
 * child, which reaches the live `AgentSession` the TUI drives. A typed `/plan`
 * or `/goal` is therefore answered by that same extension rather than refused —
 * the extension registers the real command names as aliases, so the docs' syntax
 * works too. `plan-review` and `guided-goal` stay listed: neither has a
 * counterpart the extension can honour from a prompt.
 *
 * `btw` is listed because omp's entry is TUI-only — the chamber's own `/btw`
 * is intercepted before this predicate is consulted (see `dispatchBtwCommand`),
 * so the two never conflict.
 */

 *
 * Derived rather than restated: a second hand-kept list is exactly what drifts,
 * and a name that moved into `CHAMBER_COMMANDS` without a matching row here
 * would be refused by the very guard that exists to protect it.
