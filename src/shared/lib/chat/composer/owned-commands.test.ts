/**
 * The TUI-only guard vs the commands the chamber now owns.
 *
 * `/plan` and `/goal` are `handleTui`-only in omp, so the guard would refuse a
 * prompt carrying one — but the chamber drives both modes through its own
 * extension inside the child, so a typed `/plan` is a real command now. The two
 * lists have to agree: a name that moved into `CHAMBER_COMMANDS` without
 * leaving `TUI_ONLY_SLASH_COMMANDS` would be refused by the very guard that
 * exists to protect it, and the composer would offer a command that never runs.
