/**
 * Which renderer an artifact omp spilled to disk should go through.
 *
 * The "Full output" reader used to put the whole stream in a `<pre>`, which is
 * wrong for every shape omp actually spills — measured over the 1,684 artifacts
 * of one install: 696 `bash-original` (505 plain logs, 156 markdown documents,
 * 32 JSON bodies, 3 numbered code excerpts), 228 `eval` (119 of them JSON), 70
 * `read` (44 markdown fetched from a URL), and 184 carrying a `git diff`. Raw,
 * a JSON dump arrives unformatted, a numbered excerpt welds its gutter onto the
 * code, and a markdown body shows its `#`/`|` source.
 *
 * The ORDER below is the whole contract and each step was a bug first:
 *
 *  1. **diff before everything.** A unified diff opens `--- a/x`, and `--- `
 *     matches the markdown list rule, so a diff classified later arrives as
 *     markdown and renders as prose.
 *  2. **json by the WHOLE payload.** `detectOutputFormat` refuses a JSON body
 *     over 100 kB, which is exactly the `eval` dump this reader exists for, so
 *     the brace test and the parse are done here without that cap.
 *  3. **code by its gutter.** `parseNumberedCode` is the same predicate the
 *     `read`/`edit` panels use, so an excerpt is not re-derived differently.
 *  4. markdown, then plain text.
 *
 * Pure and DOM-free: the modal's dispatch is testable without a renderer.
