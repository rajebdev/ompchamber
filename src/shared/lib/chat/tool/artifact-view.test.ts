/**
 * Which renderer a spilled artifact gets.
 *
 * The reader used to show every artifact as a `<pre>`, so this is the decision
 * that was missing. Each case below is a shape measured on a real install
 * (1,684 artifacts): a `bash` whose stdout IS a diff (184 files), an `eval`
 * that returned JSON (119), a `read` of a URL that answered markdown (44), and
 * a numbered excerpt (11). The ORDER matters too, and is pinned here: a unified
 * diff opens `--- a/x`, which is also a markdown bullet, so a diff classified
 * after markdown renders as prose.
