/**
 * How much of a long tool output is actually rendered.
 *
 * `MAX_OUTPUT_LINES` (1000) is a cap on how much text a panel KEEPS, not on how
 * much it should MOUNT: a 1000-line build log inside a `max-h-72` (288px) box
 * draws ~15 visible rows and 985 that no one can see, and the search panel's
 * virtualized list measured what that costs when it was done at scale (34s of
 * blocked main thread for one scroll over 19,376 mounted rows).
 *
 * The window opens on the TAIL, because a build log's answer is at its end —
 * the same end `truncateTailLines` already kept. Revealing walks upward, so
 * "show earlier" adds the lines a reader is scrolling back for without
 * discarding the ones they were reading.
 *
 * Pure and DOM-free so the policy is testable without a renderer.
