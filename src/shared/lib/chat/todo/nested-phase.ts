/**
 * A `todo` init-list entry that ended up recorded as a TASK.
 *
 * omp's schema wants `list: [{ phase, items: string[] }]`. A model routinely
 * sends the same shape under the wrong key — `items: [{ phase, items }, …]` —
 * and the runtime stringifies each nested object rather than rejecting the
 * call, so the phase object lands in `details.phases[].tasks[].content` (and in
 * the summary text) as one JSON blob. Verified on a real session: the model's
 * five intended phases were recorded as five `Tasks` entries whose content is
 * the literal text `{"phase":"Fondasi auth server","items":[…]}`, and omp's own
 * HUD reads the same blob back out of the transcript.
 *
 * The blob is therefore real data, not a display artifact, and every reader
 * that shows a task has to decide what to do with it. This module is that
 * decision for the chat timeline's tool card: a content that IS an init-list
 * entry is drawn as the phase it names, instead of as JSON. The check is
 * deliberately strict — the whole string must be the object, with a string
 * `phase` and a non-empty array of string `items` — so a task that merely
 * mentions JSON is left alone.
