 * Platform sniffing for the surfaces that label a keyboard shortcut.
 *
 * The labels ("⌘F" vs "Ctrl+F") and the modifiers they match have to come from
 * one place: a shortcut that is documented as ⌘F but only bound to Ctrl+F is
 * worse than an unlabeled one. `navigator.platform` is deprecated in favour of
 * `userAgentData.platform`, but the replacement is Chromium-only — and these
 * checks only choose a modifier label, so the deprecated source is the one that
 * answers on every engine. Guarded for the server, where `navigator` does not
 * exist (shared modules are imported by both bundles).
