 * How a search hit is split for rendering when a replacement is being typed.
 *
 * The search row shows the match, and once the replace field holds text it
 * shows what the line would become — the old text struck through and the new
 * text beside it, the way VS Code's search view does. The split lives here, as
 * pure arithmetic, because the row must not re-derive the ranges the server
 * already computed: a preview that disagrees with the offsets the editor is
 * pointed at is the failure this exists to prevent.
 *
 * The replacement is taken VERBATIM, not expanded: it is the template the user
 * typed, and showing `$1` in the preview while the write path expands it would
 * promise a line the file never receives. VS Code's own preview does the same.
