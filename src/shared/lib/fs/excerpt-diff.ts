/**
 * omp's excerpt diff → a unified diff.
 *
 * The diff omp puts on an `edit` result's `details.diff` is NOT unified: every
 * row carries the file's own line number as a gutter, and a change is marked by
 * a sign in front of that number rather than at the start of the line.
 *
 *   ' 41|'                          context
 *   '-43|  return new Promise(…);'  removed
 *   '+43|  const { promise, … };'   added
 *
 * Rendered by a unified-diff parser that gutter is simply code: the row reads
 * `-43|  return …` and the line numbers the reader needs are inside the text
 * they are trying to read (measured in the browser: the `43|` prefix survived
 * into the code cell). This module drops the gutter and emits the standard
 * shape, so ONE parser and ONE renderer serve both omp's excerpt and git's own
 * unified diff.
 *
 * The gutter numbers are also recovered as `oldLine`/`newLine`, which is what
 * lets the renderer draw real line numbers instead of `...`.
