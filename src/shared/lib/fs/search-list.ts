/**
 * The search result list as a FLAT, measurable sequence — the arithmetic the
 * panel needs to paint only the rows on screen.
 *
 * A search for a common word returns tens of thousands of hits, and every one
 * of them used to become a DOM node with its own syntax-highlighted markup
 * (measured on this repo: 19,376 rows, 385,706 nodes, 34 s of blocked main
 * thread for one scroll gesture). The rows are therefore laid out here, away
 * from the DOM, so the renderer can ask "which indices are visible?" and mount
 * only those.
 *
 * Two properties make the layout EXACT rather than estimated, and both come
 * from the row markup:
 *
 * - Every row is a single line. A hit is `truncate`d and a group header is one
 *   flex line, so all rows of a kind are the same height.
 * - The heights themselves are measured once from the real DOM
 *   (`Results.tsx`) and passed in, so a font or zoom change is picked up
 *   instead of being frozen into a constant.
 *
 * Gaps live here too, as part of each row's own height, because the virtualized
 * list cannot use `space-y-*`: a CSS margin between siblings only applies to
 * siblings that exist, and a windowed list has a different set of siblings on
 * every scroll.
