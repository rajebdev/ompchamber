/**
 * Line-ending preservation for the file-editing surfaces.
 *
 * Two independent transports destroy the distinction, so the file's own ending
 * has to be carried out of band rather than inferred from the buffer:
 *
 * - A `<textarea>` cannot hold a CRLF. The HTML spec defines its *API value* as
 *   the raw value with every carriage return removed, so the instant a CRLF file
 *   is placed in the editing surface the buffer is LF-only — verified in
 *   Chromium: `textarea.value = 'a\r\nb'` reads back `'a\nb'`.
 * - `multipart/form-data` normalizes the other way: every bare LF in a field
 *   value becomes CRLF in transit (the HTML serializer on the way out, Bun's
 *   parser agreeing on the way in). A save payload therefore cannot say "LF" no
 *   matter what the buffer held.
 *
 * Saving the buffer as-is rewrote the whole file's line endings on a
 * one-character edit — every line showed as changed in `git diff`. The ending is
 * detected at read and travels as its own field; the server builds the bytes.
 * An unedited save is then byte-identical and an edited save a one-line diff.
 *
 * Detection is by the FIRST terminator rather than a vote over all of them: a
 * file is overwhelmingly uniform, and the first ending is the one the author's
 * editor writes. A file with no terminator, or one using lone CR (classic Mac
 * OS), reads as `lf`.
