/**
 * A bounded memo in front of the syntax highlighter, for the one caller that
 * runs it per VISIBLE row rather than per document: the search results list.
 *
 * Shiki tokenization is the expensive half of rendering a search hit — measured
 * at 0.209 ms for a short line and 7.2 ms for a long one, and a scroll of the
 * result list re-ran it for every mounted row. Rows are memoized, but a
 * virtualized list unmounts them as they leave the viewport, so scrolling back
 * would tokenize the same line again without this.
 *
 * The key is the exact triple the output depends on — the line, the language
 * and the match ranges — so a hit that moves under a new query misses rather
 * than painting the previous query's highlight.
 *
 * The bound is entry COUNT, not bytes: a row's markup is proportional to its
 * line, and the lines here are single file lines, so 2000 entries is a few
 * hundred KB in the worst case and keeps a full viewport's worth (plus the
 * scroll-back history around it) resident.
