 * Find matches spliced into the highlighter's own markup.
 *
 * The find widget's highlights ride on the same layer the tokens do, so a mark
 * can never drift from the text it belongs to. That means walking each token's
 * content and inserting `<mark>` around the parts of it a match covers — a
 * match routinely spans several tokens (`const alpha` is three) and a token
 * routinely holds several matches.
 *
 * `<mark>` is not decoration: it is an INLINE element with a background and no
 * padding or border, which is what keeps the transparent `<textarea>` above the
 * layer aligned with the glyphs underneath. Anything that changes the box —
 * a block display, a border, an outline with an offset — moves the text under
 * the caret and breaks editing.
 *
 * Kept out of `syntax-highlight.ts` so the tokenizer module stays under the
 * repository's line ceiling and because this is the find feature's concern
 * inside the highlight pipeline, not the highlighter's.
