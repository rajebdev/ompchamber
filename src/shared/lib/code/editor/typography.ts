 * The editor's typography, in one place.
 *
 * The desktop editor and the phone's full-screen editor are the same surface on
 * two layouts, so their text has to be the same text — the same face and the
 * same line box. It was not: the stack was written out as a literal twice in
 * the desktop editor and replaced by a bare `monospace` on the phone, which
 * dropped Fira Code (and the ligatures the whole console is typeset in) and put
 * the phone's line numbers in a different face from the code beside them — the
 * gutter was already `font-mono`.
 *
 * `EDITOR_LINE_HEIGHT` is a ratio rather than a pixel value for the reason the
 * desktop editor already used one: the zoom control changes the font size, and
 * a fixed pixel line box keeps the rows at the size they were chosen for at
 * 12px — cramped at 18px, loose at 10px. It has to be applied to the gutter as
 * well as the editor, because with word wrap off the gutter rows carry no
 * explicit height and take their spacing from their own line-height; a gutter
 * pinned to a different value drifts out of register with the lines it counts.
 *
 * The two layouts keep their own padding and gutter width — a phone has less
 * room, and the padding is chrome, not type. Everything that decides how a
 * glyph is drawn lives here.

 * rendering a blank or a system serif — which is what makes this setting safe
 * to offer without shipping every font in the list. Only Fira Code is bundled;
