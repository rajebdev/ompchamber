 * A previewed file is not a chat message: `![](docs/hero.png)` means the image

 * Neither resolves on its own — the preview is an app route, so a relative URL
 * is requested from the server's own origin (`/docs/hero.png` → 404, and a
 * click would navigate the console away from itself). Each one is rewritten to
 * the workspace file it points at: images through `/api/fs/raw` (real bytes,
 * real content-type) and links through the same URL plus the resolved path in
 * `data-file-path`, which the panel turns back into an editor tab.
 *
 * Only plain relative references are touched. Anything with a scheme
 * (`https:`, `mailto:`, `data:`), a protocol-relative `//host`, or a bare
 * `#anchor` is the document's own business and is left exactly as written.
