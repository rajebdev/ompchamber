 * editor panel (source and diff tabs separately, since a diff wants room a
 * file view does not) and each right-panel view (see `right-panels.ts`).
 * Collapsing those into one slot per group is what made switching a panel look
 * like a reset. The chat column is the group's filler — flexbox sizes it — so
 * it has no remembered width, only a floor it may not be pushed below.
 *
 * Two units, deliberately:
 *
 * - The **sidebar** is pixels. It holds a session list, which does not get more
 *   useful on a wider monitor, and OpenChamber's sidebar is pixels too.
 * - The **editor and right panels** are a *share of the group's available
 *   area*. A pixel width is only right on the display it was dragged on; a
 *   fraction follows a window resize. A remembered pixel value is kept
 *   alongside as the fallback for the window before the area is measured and
 *   for blobs written before the fraction existed.
 *
 * Sizes persist per session as `layout.panelWidths` in `session_ui_state`.
