/**
 * Which presets the Add Provider picker may offer, and how they are grouped.
 *
 * The rule differs by preset kind, because the two kinds write different things:
 *
 * - A **bundled** preset names a provider omp already ships (Anthropic, Azure,
 *   Bedrock, Vertex, Codex). Its entry in `models.yml` is an OVERRIDE — omp
 *   keeps serving its own model list and only the endpoint changes — and the
 *   writer is add-only, so re-offering it is safe and is the documented way to
 *   point a built-in provider at a proxy.
 * - Any other preset creates a provider entry of its own, so a slug that is
 *   already DEFINED — connected, or carrying its own `baseUrl` in models.yml or
 *   the chamber overlay — is not re-offered; that provider is managed from the
 *   sidebar, which can reconnect it and edit its endpoint.
 *
 * `status` alone is the wrong test: omp reports ~60 providers it merely
 * KNOWS (`get_login_providers`), which are `disconnected` with no endpoint and
 * no credential. Treating those as "already added" hid every gateway preset —
 * the one case where a user wants to bring their own key.
 */
