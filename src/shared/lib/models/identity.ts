 * and `kenari`, `deepseek-v4-pro` likewise, …). Keying a lookup, a selection or
 * a mutation on the id alone resolves to whichever provider comes first —
 * hovering one row highlights the other provider's row, and toggling a
 * favourite or a thinking preset mutates the wrong model.
 *
 * `modelKey` is the single composite identity every lookup/map/React key must
 * agree on, so the pieces cannot drift apart.
