/**
 * Server-authoritative per-session stream status, persisted in SQLite so the
 * sidebar can render spinner/check. Statuses:
 *
 *   stream  — a run is in flight (prompt dispatch → agent_end)
 *   finish  — the run ended normally (agent_end), not yet seen
 *   abort   — the user stopped it, not yet seen
 *
 * A terminal status is a one-shot badge: opening the session acknowledges it
 * (`markStreamSeen` deletes the row), which is exactly the "check appears
 * once, disappears when the session is opened" contract.
 *
 * A row also carries the MODEL serving that run (`model_provider` + `model_id`),
 * written by the dispatcher that owns the `stream` row and updated only when the
 * writer actually knows the model — so the generating indicator names the real
 * provider/model, in every tab and every chamber instance, with no per-session
 * JSONL read.
 *
 * `stream` rows record the pid of the chamber process running that session, so
 * a `stream` row whose owner is gone self-heals to `finish` — see
 * `healStaleStreamStatuses`. Ownership travels in the row because the database
 * is SHARED by every chamber instance on the machine (~/.ompchamber/db.sqlite)
 * while the runtime session registry is per process: without the column, a
 * second instance opening its sidebar judged the first instance's live run by
 * its own empty registry and cleared a spinner that was still working.
 *
 * Every write raises the realtime `stream-status` signal, which is what the
 * socket's `sidebar:status` topic publishes from. All writes are
 * fire-and-forget: a status write must never fail a prompt.
