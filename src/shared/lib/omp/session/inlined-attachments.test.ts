/**
 * Recovery of inlined text attachments from a delivered prompt.
 *
 * The composer does not send a text file as data — it appends the file to the
 * prompt as `Attached file: <name>` plus a fenced block, and that composed
 * prompt is the only record omp keeps. `stripInlinedTextAttachments` removes
 * those blocks so the timeline shows the user's own words, which also discards
 * the names: a reloaded session then showed an image chip and nothing for the
 * `.md`/`.py`/`.json` that rode beside it.
 *
 * These tests pin the round trip, including the adversarial cases the format
 * allows: content that itself contains a run of backticks (the fence grows to
 * outrun it) and content that literally reads `Attached file:`.
