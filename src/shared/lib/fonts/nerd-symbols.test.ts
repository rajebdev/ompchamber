/**
 * The terminal's Nerd Font coverage is one contract split across three files,
 * and every way it can break is silent at runtime:
 *
 * - The bundled face's family name is written twice — in the stack
 *   (`XTERM_FONT_FAMILY`) and in the `@font-face` (`nerd-symbols.css`). If they
 *   drift, the face loads and nothing uses it: prompts render as tofu boxes
 *   with no error anywhere.
 * - The face must stay LAST in the stack. Moved ahead of the installed families
 *   it would win on every machine, which both changes the glyph shapes a user
 *   with a Nerd Font already sees AND makes every desktop download 1.1 MB it
 *   never needed. That is a bandwidth regression with no visible symptom on the
 *   developer's own laptop.
 * - The font file and its `unicode-range` must agree. A range that names
 *   codepoints the subset dropped leaves those glyphs as tofu even though the
 *   face is loaded and "working".
 *
 * These assertions are cheap and each one pins a failure this change was made
 * to prevent, so they are permanent rather than throwaway.
