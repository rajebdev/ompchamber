/**
 * The hand-off from a search row to whichever editor opens its file.
 *
 * A click on a result has to do two things that happen at different times: open
 * the tab (synchronously, through `omp:open-file`) and point the editor at the
 * match (only once the file's bytes are on screen). The tab entry is persisted
 * per session, so the target cannot ride on it — a reload would restore a
 * request that was already served. It lives here instead, as one pending
 * request, and the editor that finds its file open consumes it.
 *
 * The request names a LINE, not a column, and that is exact rather than
 * approximate: ripgrep emits one frame per matched line, so one row is one line
 * and "the first match on this line" is the hit the user clicked. A column
 * would have to be an offset into the row's trimmed text, which says nothing
 * about where the line starts in the file.
 *
 * `path` is the workspace-relative path both surfaces already speak, so the
 * editor can decide by equality whether the request is for the file it holds.
