/**
 * Loading plugin bundles into the page.
 *
 * A plugin's bundle is a real ESM module served from the marketplace, so the
 * host loads it with a dynamic `import()` of its own URL. That is the whole
 * mechanism — there is no sandbox, no message channel and no separate realm,
 * which is exactly what lets a plugin render components into the host's tree.
 *
 * Two properties are load-bearing:
 *
 * - **A bundle is imported ONCE.** The browser caches a module by URL, so a
 *   second `import()` of the same URL returns the first evaluation and never
 *   re-runs `setup` — which is correct (a plugin's registrations must not
 *   double) but means a REBUILT plugin needs a different URL. The server
 *   includes the build's content hash in the URL for that reason.
 * - **A failed plugin is reported, not skipped.** A bundle that 404s, throws on
 *   evaluation or exports the wrong shape leaves a reason in the slot store, and
 *   the settings pane renders it. Silence would read as "this plugin contributes
 *   nothing", which is the one thing a user cannot debug.
