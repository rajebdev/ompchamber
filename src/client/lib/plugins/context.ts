/**
 * The context every plugin component is rendered with.
 *
 * A plugin component runs inside the host's tree, so it could in principle read
 * the session and workspace from the host's own hooks — but it is a published
 * package that must not import from the host's source. This module is the seam:
 * the layout PUBLISHES the current context here, the UI kit READS it through
 * `configureUiKit`, and neither end knows about the other.
 *
 * It is deliberately one module-level value rather than a Preact context: the
 * UI kit's `usePanelInfo` subscribes to it directly, and a context object would
 * have to be threaded through every surface that renders a plugin — the
 * activity bar, the panel stack, the navbar dropdown, the editor tab and the
 * settings pane — each of which would be a place to forget it.
