/**
 * The plugin runtime: the modules every plugin bundle borrows from the host.
 *
 * A plugin bundle is built with `preact`, `preact/hooks`, `preact/jsx-runtime`,
 * `preact/compat`, `@ompchamber/plugin-sdk/app`, `@ompchamber/ui` and
 * `@ompchamber/ui/components` marked EXTERNAL; the build rewrites each of those
 * specifiers to read `globalThis.__ompchamberPluginRuntime.<slot>`. That is the
 * whole reason the host publishes this object:
 *
 * - **One Preact.** A plugin that bundled its own copy would create components
 *   the host's tree cannot render: hooks resolve through a module-level state
 *   object, so two copies produce `Cannot read properties of undefined (reading
 *   '__H')` at the first render. It is not a size optimisation.
 * - **One UI kit, one SDK.** `@ompchamber/ui` reads the host's injected
 *   services, so a plugin must get the host's instance, not its own.
 *
 * The slot names are frozen by `@ompchamber/plugin-sdk/app`'s
 * `PluginRuntimeSlots`; a change here is a change to the published contract and
 * needs the build's shim list updated in the same commit.
