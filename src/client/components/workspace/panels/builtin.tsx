 * The built-in right-panel views, as one table.
 *
 * This is the built-in half of the panel catalog, and it exists so the built-in
 * views and the installed plugins travel the SAME path: the activity bar, the
 * desktop panel stack and the phone's tab bar read one merged list, and
 * enablement is one set of ids. Before this the built-ins were three literal
 * objects — `RIGHT_PANEL_TYPES` for the order, `PANEL_META` for the titles and
 * icons, `lazy-panels.tsx` for the components — that had to agree by hand.
 *
 * Two properties are load-bearing:
 *
 * - **The components are `lazy()` at module scope.** A built-in panel's code is
 *   still split into its own chunk and fetched only when the view is first
 *   rendered, which is what `lazy-panels.tsx` used to arrange. Because the
 *   `lazy()` wrapper is created ONCE, its identity is stable across renders —
 *   which is what keeps a view mounted (and its tree expansion, terminal buffer
 *   and search results alive) while the layout hides it with CSS.
 * - **`requiresWorkspace` is data, not a condition at a call site.** A view that
 *   reads the working tree is inert until a folder is active; a view that reads
 *   the SESSION (todos, a plan, a browser, usage) is not, and gating those made
 *   them show "No session selected" over content they could draw. The phone's
 *   drawer and the desktop stack both consult this, so the two cannot disagree.
