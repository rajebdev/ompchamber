/**
 * The composer's two goal surfaces, in one place: the strip above the input and
 * the modal behind it.
 *
 * Both read the same `modes` slice and both are gated on `goalOpen` — a goal
 * the chat still owns, which is NOT omp's `enabled` flag (pausing clears that
 * while the record stays resumable). Keeping the gate in one file is what stops
 * the strip and the modal from disagreeing about whether this chat has a goal.
 *
 * Split out of `ChatInput` for the repo's per-file ceiling, not for reuse: the
 * modal's open state stays in the composer, because the toolbar's Goal button
 * is its other trigger.
