/**
 * Plan and Goal mode toggles for the composer toolbar.
 *
 * Two icon-only buttons beside the access selector. They are pressed states,
 * not menus: `aria-pressed` carries the mode, the `title` and `aria-label` name
 * it (a bare `<svg onClick>` is unreachable by keyboard and unreadable to a
 * screen reader — the rule the editor and diff toolbars already follow).
 *
 * ## Why the strip is a container query
 *
 * The composer sits in a chat panel that can be 320px wide on a 1440px screen,
 * so viewport breakpoints are the wrong axis: `sm:` would keep every label on
 * and overflow the panel. Each button therefore hides its LABEL below
 * `@[420px]` and keeps the icon, which is what the diff toolbar learned when a
 * 361px action strip overflowed a 296px box with no scrollbar to say so.
 *
 * ## Why Goal opens a modal
 *
 * Plan mode is a boolean: on means "explore before editing". Goal mode is not —
 * it needs an objective and, optionally, a token budget, and omp refuses
 * `createGoal` without an objective. So the Goal button opens `GoalModal` when
 * it is off, and offers pause/resume/drop when it is on.
