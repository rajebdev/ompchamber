 * Picking which of the panel's two reports to render.
 *
 * The right panel has two read paths for the same question: the realtime `usage`
 * topic (the read path — the server pushes when a provider or key changes) and
 * `GET /api/settings/usage` (the first paint, and the user's own Refresh, which
 * forces past the server's one-minute quota cache).
 *
 * Precedence cannot be a fixed `topic ?? http`: the manual Refresh returns the
 * FRESHER report over HTTP while the topic still holds its earlier snapshot, so
 * the refresh would look like it did nothing. Both payloads carry the
 * server's own `generatedAt`, so the later read wins and the two paths cannot
 * disagree about which is current.
