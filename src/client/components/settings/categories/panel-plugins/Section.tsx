/**
 * The panel-plugin marketplace: what is available, what is installed, and how

 *
 * Three lists, and the split between them is the feature. **Available** is the
 * bundled marketplace — a STORE, so a plugin the package ships is an offer and
 * nothing more until the user installs it (VS Code's model). **Installed** is
 * what is on disk, each row carrying the switch that turns its contributions on
 * or off without deleting anything, and the slots its bundle registered.
 * Rejections are listed last, because a plugin that fails to load with no reason
 * reads as a plugin that was never installed — the single most confusing
 * failure this surface can have.
 *
 * The installed rows come from the INSTALLED list rather than from the
 * registrations: a plugin that is switched off publishes no component, so a
 * registration-derived list would drop the row the user needs to switch it back
 * on.
