/**
 * The workspace folders a scheduled task can run in, as NUMERIC folder ids.
 *
 * Deliberately not `useWorkspaceRoots`: that hook exposes each folder's project
 * PATH as the option id (which is what the skills/commands panels scope by),
 * while a task stores the folder's row id and resolves the path server-side at
 * write time. Reusing it here would mean parsing `folder-<n>` back out of a
 * string, and a folder renamed after the task was created would then keep a
 * stale path the user cannot see or fix.
