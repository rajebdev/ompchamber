/**
 * The "an update is available" popup.
 *
 * Shown automatically ONCE PER VERSION: the version check already runs on mount
 * (see `useUpdates`), and this dialog is the place where its verdict is acted on
 * — the footer's update dot said something was available, and without this the
 * user had to open About to find out what. `omp_update_popup_version` records the
 * version that has been announced, so the same release never interrupts twice
 * while the next one still announces itself.
 *
 * It opens only when a check has actually reported an update, and the release
 * range is fetched AFTER that gate — a normal boot with nothing to announce
 * makes no GitHub request for this.
 *
 * The dialog is mounted by whichever layout is on screen (desktop and mobile
 * sidebars both own it, as they own the About modal), and the latch is read from
 * SQLite rather than held in memory, so the two cannot both announce a version.
