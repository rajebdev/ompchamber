/**
 * The settings sidebar's "Reload OMP Engine" action.
 *
 * A reload here means RECYCLE, not re-read: the server disposes every standby
 * omp process — the pooled utility children that answer the provider and model
 * lists and the composer's `/` popup, plus the prewarmed session hosts — so the
 * next command boots the binary currently installed. That is the only way to
 * pick up an `omp update` without restarting the chamber: a live omp child is
 * the build it was spawned from for its whole life.
 *
 * Live sessions are deliberately untouched (the server owns that decision), so
 * this is safe to press at any time — a chat mid-turn keeps streaming.
 *
 * The client caches that mirror those lists are dropped on success, because a
 * recycled server behind a 5-minute client cache would still show the old
 * commands in the `/` popup.
