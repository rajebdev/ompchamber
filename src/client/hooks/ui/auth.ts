/**
 * Client-side UI-auth state, and the one place a 401 is noticed.
 *
 * The app has 128 `fetch` call sites across 65 files and no shared HTTP client,
 * so a gate that each caller had to honour would be a gate most callers forget.
 * Instead `installAuthFetchBridge` wraps `window.fetch` once at boot and watches
 * the responses that already flow through it: a 401 from this origin's `/api/`,
 * other than the auth family itself, means the session is gone and the store
 * flips to `required`. Every surface then disappears behind the login screen
 * without any of them knowing auth exists. The `/api/auth/` exclusion is not an
 * optimisation — those endpoints answer 401 about the credential the caller
 * just supplied, and reading that as a lost session is what put a signed-in
 * user behind the login screen over a mistyped password.
 *
 * The bootstrap decides the initial state. The server only injects
 * `appSettings` for an authenticated request, so it already knows the answer —
 * asking again with `/api/auth/state` on every load would be a round trip to
 * learn something the page was told.
 *
 * This is not a security boundary and does not pretend to be: the server refuses
 * every request regardless. It only decides what the user sees.
