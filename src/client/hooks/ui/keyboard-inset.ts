/**
 * How far a bottom-anchored panel must lift so a soft keyboard does not cover
 * it.
 *
 * The measurement is taken from the PANEL'S OWN geometry, not from
 * `window.innerHeight`: the overlap between the panel's bottom edge and the
 * visible bottom edge is what actually matters, and it is self-correcting.
 *
 * The difference matters because `innerHeight` is not a stable reference. A
 * browser that shrinks it when the keyboard opens, a `dvh` container that
 * tracks it, or a panel that already ends above the keyboard all change what
 * "the keyboard height" means — and computing `innerHeight - visualHeight`
 * against a height that already moved lifts the panel by the keyboard's height
 * a second time, which is the too-far margin. Deriving the lift from the
 * overlap yields zero in every one of those cases and the exact height only
 * when the panel genuinely runs under the keyboard.
 *
 * Deliberately local to the panel that uses it. Putting
 * `interactive-widget=resizes-content` in the viewport meta would solve this
 * globally, but it changes how every surface in the app sizes itself when the
 * keyboard opens — a whole-app layout decision, not a terminal one.
