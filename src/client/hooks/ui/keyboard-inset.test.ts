/**
 * The keyboard-inset arithmetic.
 *
 * The failure this file exists for is an OVER-lift: computing the keyboard's
 * height from `innerHeight - visualHeight` and applying it to a panel that does
 * not reach the screen's bottom edge (a drawer with safe-area padding, a
 * container a browser already shrank) lifts by the keyboard's height PLUS the
 * gap the panel never had. Deriving the lift from the panel's own overlap makes
 * every one of those cases zero.
