/**
 * True when an element's content is visually cut off by CSS truncation.
 *
 * `text-overflow: ellipsis` hides content at a WIDTH, not at a character count,
 * and the two are unrelated: the same 76-character line fits a 970px desktop
 * timeline and is cut on a 340px phone card. A caller that decides "is there
 * more to show?" from `text.length` therefore renders an ellipsis the user can
 * see and no way to reveal it — the exact failure this hook exists to prevent.
 *
 * `scrollWidth > clientWidth` is the measurement the browser itself uses to
 * decide whether to draw the ellipsis, so it cannot disagree with what is on
 * screen. Three details are load-bearing:
 *
 * - A zero-width element reports 0 for BOTH values, which reads as "fits". That
 *   is not a measurement, it is the absence of one (a `display: none` ancestor,
 *   a detached node), so it is skipped and the previous answer stands.
 * - The measurement is retained when the ref detaches. Callers unmount the
 *   truncated row as soon as it expands, and forgetting the answer there would
 *   retract the very control the user just used.
 * - A webfont that lands after first paint changes the text's width without
 *   resizing the box, so `ResizeObserver` alone never fires. `document.fonts`
 *   is the one signal for it.
