/**
 * The 401 → login-screen bridge.
 *
 * What it must NOT do is the point of this file. A 401 is the answer to a
 * question as often as it is a lost session — `POST /api/auth/password` answers
 * one to a mistyped current password — and reading it as a lost session put a
 * signed-in user's whole workspace behind the login screen over an ordinary
 * typo. So the store must stay where it is for anything under `/api/auth/`, flip
 * for a gated route, and ignore anything that is not this origin's `/api/`.
 *
 * Runs against a real DOM (happy-dom) because the bridge wraps `window.fetch`.
 * A static import is safe here, unlike the DOM-binding modules: nothing in
 * `auth.ts` touches a global at evaluation time, and the install happens inside
 * `beforeAll`, after the window exists.
