/**
 * Subscribe a component to one realtime topic.
 *
 * The reader every data-backed panel shares: the server pushes when a topic
 * changes, so a panel renders what it is handed instead of asking on a timer.
 *
 * Two rules carried over from the polling hooks it replaced, because they were
 * right:
 *
 *   - **`enabled: false` subscribes to nothing.** A hidden panel — or one whose
 *     session is not selected — must not keep a subscription alive, or the
 *     server would produce snapshots nobody renders.
 *   - **A topic switch drops the old value first.** The panel's topic encodes
 *     the session it describes, so rendering the previous session's data under
 *     the new title is the failure this prevents.
 *
 * `stale` is surfaced rather than hidden: it means the socket is down or a
 * sequence gap was seen, and a panel should say so instead of showing a value
 * of unknown age as if it were current.
