 * Whether this device is typed into with a soft keyboard — the only condition

 * `(pointer: coarse)` is the signal: a phone or tablet reports it, and a
 * touchscreen laptop does not, because its primary pointer is the trackpad.
 * The fallback covers the devices that report a fine pointer anyway (some
 * Android desktop modes): touch points plus `(hover: none)`, which is the pair
 * that means "there is no pointer at all" rather than "there is a screen that
 * can be touched".
 *
 * The queries are subscribed, not read once: a hybrid device that docks a
 * keyboard or leaves tablet mode changes the answer, and a bar of keys that
 * cannot react to that is stuck on a desktop or missing on a phone.
