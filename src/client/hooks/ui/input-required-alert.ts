 * App-wide "an agent is blocked on you" cue.

 * It runs off the shared session list rather than the open timeline, which is
 * the whole point: the agent that needs an answer is usually NOT the session on
 * screen — you sent a prompt in one workspace and moved to another. The list is
 * fed by the sidebar loader (which derives `awaitingInput` from the live omp
 * process registry), so the cue reaches the client even when that process'
 * session was never opened.
