 * to a sibling file — a duplicate sidebar row with the same title and a split
 * conversation. When the owner is another CHAMBER instance, the refusal carries
 * its port, and the right answer is not an error message: it is to open the
 * session there, since both instances share one database and one agent dir.
 *
 * A holder the chamber cannot place (an `omp` CLI run) has no `ownerPort`, so
 * the caller keeps the plain refusal.
