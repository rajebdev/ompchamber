/**
 * `/btw [question]` typed into the main composer is the side-question entry
 * point, not chat text: the panel owns the token (omp's `/btw` is TUI-only, so
 * nothing downstream would understand it). This module is the whole
 * interception — recognize the command and hand it, with the composer's
 * attachments, to the panel over `omp:btw`.
 *
 * The attachments cross as the composer's own `Attachment` objects, not as
 * pre-built provider payloads: the side session accepts the same shapes the chat
 * does (images as payloads, text files inlined into the prompt), and it makes
 * that split itself — from the fields the attach step already filled in.
 *
 * It lives beside the rest of the client-side btw state (`hooks/chat/btw/`)
 * rather than in the send handler: the attachment read goes through the shared
 * accessors, because `Attachment.file` is absent on every replayed attachment.
