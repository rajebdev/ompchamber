/**
 * The composer's Plan/Goal mode state.
 *
 * ## Why per session, not global
 *
 * The access mode is a GLOBAL preference (`useChatTimelineAccessMode`): it
 * describes how the user wants tools approved, and they want the same answer
 * everywhere. Plan and Goal mode are the opposite — they describe what THIS
 * conversation is doing. A global toggle would put every other open chat into
 * plan mode as a side effect, and two tabs on two sessions would fight.
 *
 * ## Where the truth lives
 *
 * The child process is authoritative: omp owns both modes, and every transition
 * it makes arrives as a `goal_updated` frame or a `CHAMBER_*_STATE` marker from
 * the chamber's own extension. The client mirrors that and sends intents. A
 * reload re-reads the mirror from the session's JSONL
 * (`GET /api/sessions/:id/modes`), so a chat reopened in another tab shows the
 * modes it is actually in rather than the last thing this tab requested.
