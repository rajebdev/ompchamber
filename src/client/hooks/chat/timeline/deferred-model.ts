/**
 * Composer model/thinking picks that must NOT reach the live session yet.
 *
 * omp applies `set_model` / `set_thinking_level` to the RUNNING turn: the next
 * LLM call inside the stream (the one after a tool result) goes out on the new
 * model, so a pick made while an answer streams visibly re-targets that answer
 * mid-flight. A composer pick is intent for the NEXT prompt, so while a turn is
 * running it is stashed here and pushed to the session right before the next
 * prompt the composer starts (plain send, steer, or queued delivery).
 *
 * The slot holds only what has NOT reached the session yet, so a pick applied
 * directly (idle composer) clears exactly the fields it applied — a stashed
 * thinking level survives a later model change instead of being resurrected
 * over it.
 *
 * Verified against omp's RPC handler: `set_model` resolves the model and calls
 * the session's `setModel` immediately — nothing defers it to a turn boundary.
