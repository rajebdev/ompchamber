/**
 * Chat timeline scroll container state (auto-fading scrollbar + follow-bottom
 * affordance). Extracted from useChatTimeline so that hook stays under the
 * repo's per-file size ceiling.
 *
 * The follow-bottom affordance is geometry, not an event: content that grows
 * without the user scrolling (history lands, an accordion expands, an image
 * decodes, the panel is resized) never fires `scroll`. Both the container and
 * the content wrapper are therefore observed, so a session opened at the top
 * shows the button without a single scroll event.
 *
 * Streaming auto-scroll is stick-to-bottom: `scrollToBottom` only actually
 * moves the viewport while `follow` is engaged. The user scrolling away from
 * the tail disengages it (the scroll fight is gone — they can read while the
 * AI generates); scrolling back near the tail, or clicking the scroll-bottom
 * button, re-engages it. Programmatic jumps (`scrollTo`) never flip the mode.
 *
 * `jumpToBottom` is the unconditional bypass (`follow` is re-engaged, geometry
 * is re-baselined, and the paging trigger stands down for a moment) — the
 * button's jump, the open-session jump, and the send jump all go through it.
 * `follow` lives across session switches, so an open jump that honoured it was
 * simply refused for a session opened after the user had scrolled up.
