/**
 * Refuse a slash command omp only implements in its own TUI, in the composer,
 * before it can cost a turn.
 *
 * The guard exists because the RPC prompt path has no slash handling for these
 * names: `session.prompt()` only expands file commands and prompt templates, so
 * `/plan` arrives at the model as literal text and it improvises a whole turn
 * around the string (measured: `/hotkeys` sent the model to read omp's own docs
 * and run bash). The composer already knows the token, so it answers locally
 * with the same notice row shape a real `command_output` frame produces — the
 * user sees why nothing ran, and the model never sees the command.
 *
 * Every send path funnels through here: a fresh send, a steer, a retry of a
 * stored turn, and a queued item's "send now". Queued auto-delivery is covered
 * server-side (`blockedSlashPrompt` in the RPC dispatcher), because it never
 * passes through this module.
