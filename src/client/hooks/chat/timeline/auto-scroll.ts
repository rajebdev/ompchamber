/**
 * Follow-bottom when a session is opened. Committed history is fetched
 * asynchronously (session-load.ts), so the timeline paints at `scrollTop = 0`
 * long before the messages land — and nothing else scrolls a finished session,
 * because every other trigger lives in the streaming callbacks. This jumps to
 * the tail exactly once per session, on the commit where that session's
 * messages appear.
 *
 * The jump is the UNCONDITIONAL one (`jumpToBottom`), not the follow-gated
 * `scrollToBottom`. Follow mode is a property of this mounted view, not of the
 * session being opened: a user who scrolled up before switching left it
 * disengaged, and the open then painted the top of the new session with no
 * scroll event to re-engage it — the session stayed at the head until the
 * button was clicked (reproduced: scroll up in session A, open session B,
 * `scrollTop` pinned at 0 with the jump button showing).
