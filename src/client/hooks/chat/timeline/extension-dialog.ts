/**
 * FIFO queue of pending omp ask/approval dialogs.
 *
 * omp runs a turn's tool calls concurrently, and every gated call emits its OWN
 * `extension_ui_request` and then blocks until that exact id is answered: two
 * `bash` calls in one turn under `always-ask` produce two `select` frames in the
 * same second. A single dialog slot kept only the last request, so each earlier
 * tool call stayed blocked on an approval nobody could answer and the turn never
 * reached `agent_end` — the run looked hung until Stop.
 *
 * The queue keeps EVERY pending request rather than the head alone: `ask` raises
 * one frame per question, and those are rendered inline on the ask tool card
 * (see ask-frames.ts) instead of in a modal, so the head is not the only
 * answerable request at any moment. Entries leave the queue by id once their
 * response is on the wire, or when omp withdraws them (`method: 'cancel'`).
