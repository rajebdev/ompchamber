/**
 * The New Chat dialog's first send.
 *
 * The dialog's send handler captured the render it was opened in, so it could
 * not write the pending id into the URL and dispatch the prompt itself: the
 * captured `executeSend` read that render's session, so the first prompt left
 * against the chat the dialog was opened FROM. For an omp session that meant it
 * landed in the previous chat — no spawn happened, the new chat showed an
 * optimistic bubble with no stream and no sidebar spinner (the optimistic mark
 * was armed for the wrong id), and only the SECOND prompt worked, because by
 * then the composer's own handler read the pending scope.
 *
 * The send is PARKED instead, and fired by the render that actually carries the
 * pending id it asked for. That keeps one source of truth for the scope: the
 * deferred call reads the fresh send path (`isOmpSession: false`, the pending id
 * for persistence, the spawn's cwd from the folder the chat was started in).
