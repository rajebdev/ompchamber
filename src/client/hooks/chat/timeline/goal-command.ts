/**
 * The composer's Goal command surface: what each `GoalAction` sends, and the
 * local mirror it applies when the child accepts.
 *
 * Split from `modes.ts` because that hook owns the shared state and this is a
 * closed translation — one action in, one command out plus a state patch. The
 * mirror exists because the marker that confirms the transition arrives over
 * the session's event stream, and the strip's controls are the only feedback
 * the user gets: measured after a dev-server restart (which kills the child and
 * the client's socket), a Resume answered 200 and the goal went active in the
 * child while the row kept reading "paused" indefinitely, because nothing
 * re-attached the stream.
