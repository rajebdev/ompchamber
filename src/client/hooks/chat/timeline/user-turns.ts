/**
 * Full-history user-turn index for the timeline jump rail.
 *
 * The timeline mounts a window of a long session (newest 120 messages plus
 * whatever "Load earlier messages" paged in), so a rail built from the mounted
 * rows lists only that fraction — the bug this hook exists to fix. The index
 * comes from `/api/chat/:id/turns`, which walks the whole session with the same
 * id/merge pipeline as the timeline, so a rail tick always resolves to a row
 * the timeline can actually reach by paging.
 *
 * Live rows the committed history does not carry yet (an optimistic send in
 * flight) are appended with `index: -1` — they are on screen already, and
 * dropping them would make the rail lag one turn behind the composer.
