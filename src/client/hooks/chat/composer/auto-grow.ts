/**
 * Composer growth for a MODAL composer: the textarea sizes itself to its
 * content up to a ceiling, and the enclosing card grows with it.
 *
 * The chat composer deliberately does NOT do this — its textarea is a fixed
 * box that scrolls, because the timeline owns the space and a composer that
 * grew on every paste would move the conversation under the reader's cursor.
 * Inside a modal there is nothing to push around: the card is the only thing on
 * screen, so growing it is free, and a multi-paragraph prompt is then visible
 * while it is written.
 *
 * The ceiling is the whole point of the module: unbounded growth turns a pasted
 * transcript into a card taller than the viewport, with the toolbar and the
 * send button pushed off screen. `maxHeightPx` keeps the composer a composer,
 * and the textarea scrolls past it.
