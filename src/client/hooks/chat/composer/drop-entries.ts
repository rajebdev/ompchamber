/**
 * Turning a `DataTransfer` into the flat list of `File`s a drop attaches.
 *
 * Split out of `file-drop.ts`, which owns the event wiring: everything here is
 * about reading the payload, and it is the part with the browser rules worth
 * documenting.
 *
 * Two rules, both of which produced a bug when ignored:
 *
 * 1. A dropped DIRECTORY is not a readable File: `dataTransfer.files` carries a
 *    size-0 stub for it. Only `DataTransferItem.webkitGetAsEntry()` reveals it
 *    as a directory, so those are walked recursively and attached file by file.
 * 2. `getAsFile()` and `webkitGetAsEntry()` are read from the SAME item, and on
 *    a file-manager drag each call can consume state the other needs — so the
 *    item list is read exactly ONCE, capturing both views in a single pass.
 *
 * The `File`s this returns are only as good as the tick they were captured in:
 * a dropped file's read permission is released when the drop handler returns,
 * so `file-drop.ts` primes the reads before awaiting anything. See `file-reads.ts`.

 * separate loops over `items` therefore lose one of them; this captures both
 * while the item is still fresh.
 *
 * `dataTransfer.files` is the PREFERRED source of the `File` objects, not the
 * item list. On a file-manager drag the two are not interchangeable: the item
 * entry can carry correct metadata (name, size) over a backing store that no
 * longer reads, while `files` hands over one that does. Preferring the item list
 * produced a chip with the right name and size whose contents never arrived, and
 * the failure survived every retry because the object itself was unreadable.
 * `files` is also what the working reference implementations read first.
 *
 * The item list still earns its place: it is the ONLY way to see a dropped
 * DIRECTORY (`files` carries a size-0 stub for one), and it is the fallback for
 * a host that populates only `items`.
