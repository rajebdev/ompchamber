/**
 * Reading a dropped `File`'s bytes — and the one browser rule that makes the
 * TIMING of that read part of the contract.
 *
 * A file that arrives through a drop is not an ordinary `Blob`. The browser
 * holds a permission reference to the real file, and that reference is released
 * when the `drop` event's handler returns. A read started after that point
 * fails with `NotReadableError: ... permission problems that have occurred
 * after a reference to a file was acquired`, and it fails PERMANENTLY — every
 * retry after it fails the same way, because the reference is gone rather than
 * busy. This is why a dropped file showed a chip with a correct name and size
 * while its contents never arrived, and why three retries did not help.
 *
 * `FileReader.readAs*` checks the permission when it is CALLED, not when it
 * completes. So the read must be STARTED synchronously inside the drop handler;
 * awaiting its result later is fine. `primeFileReads` is that start, and every
 * later consumer takes the already-running read rather than beginning its own.
