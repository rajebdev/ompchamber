/**
 * Reading a drop's payload.
 *
 * Every host describes a dragged file differently, and the differences decide
 * whether a drop is accepted at all:
 *
 * - A file manager (Finder, Explorer, Nautilus) exposes real `File` entries.
 *   macOS additionally attaches a `text/plain` item carrying the absolute path,
 *   so the item list holds a `string` entry beside the `file` one.
 * - A browser page dragging a DOWNLOAD (WhatsApp Web, Gmail, Slack) has no File
 *   at all: it offers a URL in `DownloadURL` / `text/uri-list`. Gating on the
 *   `Files` type rejected those outright, which is why a file dragged out of
 *   WhatsApp never attached.
 * - VS Code's explorer offers only proprietary types whose payloads must be
 *   parsed for paths.
 *
 * These helpers answer the three questions the composer asks of a
 * `DataTransfer`, and are pure so they can be exercised without a browser.
 *
 * `getData` throws in some hosts when called during `dragover` rather than
 * `drop`; every read is guarded so one unreadable type cannot abort the scan.
