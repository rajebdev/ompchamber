/**
 * OS file drag-and-drop for the chat composer.
 *
 * Three browser rules shape this module:
 *
 * 1. A `drop` is only delivered when the preceding `dragover` was cancelled, so
 *    the handlers belong on the whole composer card — a drop aimed at the
 *    textarea bubbles up to it, and cancelling there also suppresses the
 *    browser's own "insert the dropped file's path as text" default.
 * 2. A dropped DIRECTORY is not a readable File: `dataTransfer.files` carries a
 *    size-0 stub for it. Only `DataTransferItem.webkitGetAsEntry()` reveals it
 *    as a directory, so those are walked recursively and attached file by file.
 * 3. A file dropped anywhere the app does not cancel lands in the tab as
 *    `file://` navigation, which throws the chamber away. The guard below is
 *    window-wide for exactly that reason; it only ever cancels file drags, so
 *    text and URL drops keep their native behaviour.
 *
 * What counts as a file drag is decided in `drop-payload.ts`, because hosts
 * disagree: a download dragged out of a web page offers no File at all, only a
 * URL, and those references are handed back to the caller to resolve.
 *
 * The drag data store is cleared the moment the drop handler returns, so every
 * store-bound read (`getAsFile`, `webkitGetAsEntry`, `getData`) happens
 * synchronously; the entries and Files they return stay valid while the walk
 * awaits.
