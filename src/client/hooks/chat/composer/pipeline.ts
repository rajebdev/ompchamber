/**
 * The composer's attach-and-send pipeline: everything between "a file arrived"
 * and "a prompt is dispatched", plus the one line of feedback each outcome
 * produces.
 *
 * Extracted from ChatInput so the component stays a layout shell and the
 * composer keeps room under the repo's per-file size ceiling.
 *
 * The rules encoded here, each of which was a bug once:
 *
 * - A drop registers its files in the attachment hook BEFORE the component
 *   re-renders, so a send clicked immediately afterwards must read the hook's
 *   list, not the component's `attachments` prop — that prop is a frame behind
 *   and an empty read clears the composer and dispatches nothing.
 * - A send waits for in-flight reads and then uses the list those reads
 *   returned: an attachment whose bytes landed during the wait is sent
 *   complete, never as the pre-read entry.
 * - A send that would carry neither text nor any readable attachment is
 *   REPORTED, never dispatched. An empty prompt reaching the model is worse
 *   than not sending, and it is what a failed read used to produce.
