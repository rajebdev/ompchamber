/**
 * Attachment lifecycle for the composer: accept a batch of files (picker,
 * paste, or OS drop), gate the text ones against the inline budget, hold blob
 * previews, and read the bytes into the attachment.
 *
 * Bytes are read AT ATTACH TIME, not at send time. A `File` handed over by a
 * drop or a paste is a live handle onto the drag data store, and reading it
 * later — after the composer has re-rendered, or after the drag that produced
 * it has ended — is what made a dropped file arrive with an empty body while
 * its chip still rendered. Reading once, here, means every later step (send,
 * queue, retry) works from the persisted copy.
 *
 * Two shapes of "no content yet" have to be told apart, and getting it wrong is
 * what produced a prompt sent with no message at all:
 *
 * - A file from another app arrives as a PROMISE: the entry exists before its
 *   bytes do, so the first read comes back empty. That read is retried.
 * - A genuinely empty file reads empty forever. It is accepted as-is.
 *
 * Only a read that stays empty while the file claims bytes is a failure, and a
 * failure is always reported — never silently omitted.
