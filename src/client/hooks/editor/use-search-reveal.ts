/**
 * The editor's end of a search-result hand-off.
 *
 * A result row publishes a `SearchRevealRequest` and opens the file; this hook
 * waits until THAT file's bytes are on screen, then keeps the request while the
 * document stays open so the consumer can paint every occurrence and aim the
 * caret at the one the row named.
 *
 * Two rules are load-bearing:
 *
 * - **The request is resolved against the LIVE buffer.** The marks are
 *   recomputed from the current text on every render, so editing the file after
 *   jumping to a hit keeps the highlights in the right places — the same reason
 *   the find bar re-runs its own matcher on every keystroke.
 * - **The request is consumed exactly once.** It is cleared as soon as it is
 *   served, because the target it produced is held here: without that, a
 *   re-render (or the panel re-mounting) would re-fire the caret jump and drag
 *   the view back to the match the user has since scrolled away from.
 *
 * The request is deliberately NOT persisted: it is served the moment the file
 * opens, and a request restored from storage would fire again on reload.
