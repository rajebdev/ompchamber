/**
 * The editor font setting, and how a live change reaches an open editor.
 *
 * The setting is visual, so it has to apply to the editor the user is looking
 * at — not on the next reload. That rules out reading it once from the
 * bootstrap payload the way `keybindingSend` is read: `appSettings` is a prop
 * captured at boot, so a settings change would not reach an already-mounted
 * editor. The theme solved the same problem with a window event, and this
 * follows it: the picker writes the setting AND announces it, and the editor
 * subscribes.
 *
 * The stored value is the family name. `editorFontStack` puts it in front of
 * the shared stack, so a face the device lacks falls through to the bundled
 * Fira Code instead of replacing it — which is why the picker can offer faces
 * the app does not ship.
