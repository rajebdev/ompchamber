/**
 * Nested-repo scope for the right-panel views (files, search, git, terminal).
 *
 * Every one of them needs the same two things, and both are meaningless without
 * the workspace root they describe:
 *
 *   - WHICH repo the view operates on (`useRepoScope`). A repo is a path
 *     relative to the active root — `projects/jns6_5/token` only names a
 *     directory under `~/JatisMobile/Workspace` — so a choice is only valid
 *     next to the root it was made under.
 *   - WHAT repos exist under that root (`useRepoList`), discovered server-side
 *     and stored with the root it was discovered for (see `./store`).
 *
 * Kept as bare per-panel values, both outlived the workspace they belonged to:
 * after a workspace switch the picker still listed the previous workspace's
 * repos, still showed one of them as the selection, and every request the panel
 * made named a path that did not exist under the new root. Pairing each value
 * with its root invalidates it by construction — no reset effect to order
 * against the per-session state restore — while a session returned to inside
 * the same workspace keeps the repo it was left on.
 *
 * The choice is also ONE value for all four views (`REPO_SCOPE_STATE_KEY`), not
 * one per panel: they describe the same working tree, so a repo picked in the
 * file explorer has to move the search scope, the Source Control view and a
 * terminal's cwd with it. Per-panel keys meant four pickers that could silently
 * disagree about which repository was on screen.
