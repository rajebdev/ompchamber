/**
 * Workspace-folder mutations shared by the desktop category header and the

 * rename. The fetchers and the delete confirmation flag all live here so the
 * two sidebars cannot drift on URLs or bodies; a successful mutation is
 * announced by the server (the `sidebar` topic) or on the client signal bus.
 *
 * The folder expand toggle is deliberately NOT here: the desktop submits it
 * through `useFetcher` (and re-dispatches on the response), while the mobile
 * sidebar issues a raw fetch and dispatches with a `folderId` detail. Those
 * two are not the same request/event contract, so each keeps its own.
 *
 * Callers keep their own menu-open state and the optimistic expand flag — the
 * hook is about the request + refresh, not the local UI toggles.
