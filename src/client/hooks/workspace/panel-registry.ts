/**
 * The installed panel plugins, read from the realtime `panels` topic.
 *
 * The registry is a server read, so it is cached in a module-level promise the
 * way the repo list is: every consumer (the activity bar, the panel stack, the
 * mobile tab bar) needs the same list, and re-fetching per consumer would put
 * three requests behind one page load and let them disagree while one is in
 * flight.
 *
 * The topic is what makes the list move: the server republishes `panels` after
 * every install, remove, enable/disable and plugin-file write, so a change made
 * in ANOTHER tab reaches this one too — a window event only ever reached the
 * tab that dispatched it. The one local signal left is the pane's own Refresh,
 * which must bypass the server's scan cache and is therefore a module-level
 * notify rather than a topic frame.
 *
 * The registry says which BUNDLES to load, not what they contain: a plugin's
 * panels exist only once its bundle has run, so `usePanelSlots` below is the
 * other half of this picture.
