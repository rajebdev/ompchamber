/**
 * The Files panel's listing state: the root read, the children of every open
 * folder, and the scope both belong to.
 *
 * Extracted from the panel because the two halves cannot be reasoned about
 * apart. A refresh that re-read only the ROOT left every expanded folder
 * rendering the children it had been cached with, so a file or folder deleted
 * inside one stayed on screen until the scope changed — the panel's own Refresh
 * included (measured: deleting a nested folder left it listed under its open
 * parent, and re-reading the root could not fix it, because the root listing
 * never carried that folder's children). Re-reading the open folders is
 * therefore part of what a refresh IS, not something the caller remembers to
 * ask for.
 *
 * Everything is tagged with the `root\0repo` scope it was read for, so a
 * workspace or repo switch renders nothing from the previous tree: the children
 * cache and the expansion set are keyed by paths RELATIVE to the listed root,
 * and `src/` in one workspace would otherwise rehydrate into `src/` in the next.
