/**
 * The delete route's refusal branches.
 *
 * Each one guards a different failure, and two of them are about blast radius
 * rather than tidiness: the id names a directory under the sessions root and
 * another under the btw root, so a value that is not one segment deletes far
 * more than the session it names (`.` normalized to the btw root itself and
 * wiped every session's side questions — see `fs/path-segment`).
 *
 * The route is called directly, as the other route tests do: these are pure
 * request-shape checks that must not reach the filesystem or spawn an omp
 * child, and asserting that is half the point.
