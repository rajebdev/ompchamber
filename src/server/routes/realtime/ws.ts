/**
 * The unified realtime socket — the one channel every server-originated event
 * travels on.
 *
 * A client subscribes to topics; the hub answers each with a snapshot and then
 * pushes deltas. The route is a thin adapter: it owns the connection's
 * subscription set and hands frames to `attachObserverStream`, which already
 * provides the coalescer, the 30s protocol keepalive and an idempotent teardown
 * (the same policy the agent and BTW sockets used).
 *
 * **Origin-checked**, like the terminal and dictation routes and unlike the
 * per-session agent/BTW sockets it replaces. A WebSocket upgrade carries the
 * page's `Origin` and no preflight protects it, so without this a cross-origin
 * page could subscribe to another session's stream. The root `authGate` also
 * runs on the upgrade (verified: Elysia applies `onBeforeHandle` to a composed
 * `.ws()` route), so an unauthenticated tab is refused before `open`.
 *
 * **Per-connection state lives on `ws.data`**, never in a `WeakMap` keyed by the
 * `ws` object: Elysia hands `pong` the raw socket and a fresh wrapper to every
 * other callback, so a WeakMap lookup always misses. See `@/server/lib/observer-ws`.
