/**
 * `GET /api/panels/readme/<plugin>/<path>` — a plugin's README, as markdown.
 *
 * A plugin is a repository, and its README is the material a user actually wants
 * before installing: what it does, what it needs, what it writes. Serving it
 * here lets the pane render it in the chamber's own markdown pipeline (the same
 * sanitizer, Shiki highlighting, KaTeX and mermaid hydration the chat timeline
 * uses) instead of sending the user to a git host.
 *
 * Three rules, and they are the same ones the bundle route follows:
 *
 * - **The plugin is named by its DIRECTORY, and the path is resolved INSIDE it.**
 *   A request can only ever reach a file a plugin ships; a `../` segment is
 *   refused even though the manifest that named the README was already
 *   validated, because the URL is a second entrance and the one a caller
 *   controls.
 * - **Markdown only.** A README is text; anything else is refused by extension
 *   rather than served as an opaque download under a `.md` URL.
 * - **The store is reachable, the working copy wins.** An uninstalled plugin's
 *   README has to be readable — that is the whole point of the button — while an
 *   installed plugin's own copy must win, so the reader shows what is on disk.
