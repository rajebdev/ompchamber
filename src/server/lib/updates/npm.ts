/**
 * npm registry reads for the update check.
 *
 * npm is where both targets are actually published, and therefore the version an
 * install can move to: `ompchamber update` runs `bun add -g ompchamber@<version>`,
 * and omp's own `omp update --check` resolves its metadata from the registry too
 * (verified against omp 18.6.0 with a header-recording stub: the check issued
 * exactly one request, `<registry>/@oh-my-pi%2fpi-coding-agent/latest`). Reading
 * the same channel the install comes from is what makes the reported version the
 * one that can be installed — the GitHub Releases API answered a different
 * question, and needed a token above 60 reads an hour plus a `gh` CLI fallback
 * when it answered nothing at all.
 *
 * One request per check: `/<pkg>/latest` is a single version manifest (~3 KB for
 * ompchamber, ~16 KB for omp), where the packument is the whole publish history
 * (139 KB and 7 MB respectively). The release RANGE is read from the repository's
 * CHANGELOG.md instead — see ./changelog-file.
