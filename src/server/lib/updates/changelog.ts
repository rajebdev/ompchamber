/**
 * The "What's new" range: every OMPChamber release between the version installed
 * on disk and the newest one npm serves, newest first, ready to render.
 *
 * The range is the whole point of the popup. A user three releases behind must
 * see three sections, not just the newest one — and the sections come from the
 * repository's `CHANGELOG.md` (see ./changelog-file), which is the same prose the
 * GitHub release bodies carry. Nothing here re-parses the changelog for the
 * current/latest pair or trusts a client-supplied `from`/`to`: the installed
 * version is read from disk and the newest one from npm, so a caller cannot ask
 * for a range the install does not actually have.
 *
 * Two caps bound the response, because `omp`-style repositories can publish
 * dozens of releases and one of them (measured on a sibling project) carries a
 * 43 KB body. The NEWEST releases are always kept; the trim takes the oldest,
 * which is what "showing 12 of 29" means.
