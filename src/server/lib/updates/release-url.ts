/**
 * Where OMPChamber's release notes live.
 *
 * Two questions, two sources, deliberately. The VERSION an install can move to
 * comes from npm (see ./npm) — that is the channel `bun add -g ompchamber@…`
 * installs from. The NOTES are published on GitHub: every release tag carries the
 * same `CHANGELOG.md` section the popup renders, with its compare range, commit
 * hashes and contributor credits, and the release page is where a reader can
 * follow them. So the popup's links point at GitHub while the version it
 * announces comes from the registry.
