/**
 * The release notes behind the "What's new" popup, read from the repository's
 * own `CHANGELOG.md`.
 *
 * That file IS the release notes: `release.config.mjs` writes each
 * `## [x.y.z] — YYYY-MM-DD` section from the Conventional Commits of the release
 * and posts the same prose as the GitHub release body, so reading the file gives
 * the identical text without asking the Releases API for it — no 60-per-hour
 * unauthenticated limit, no `GITHUB_TOKEN`, and no dependency on the release
 * pipeline having created a release object for the tag.
 *
 * Sections are parsed by heading, so the popup's range is decided by the versions
 * the changelog itself names: newest first, each with its date and body. The
 * heading's own compare link is dropped rather than rendered — the popup draws
 * the heading itself and links each section to that version's release page.
