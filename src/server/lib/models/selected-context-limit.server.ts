/**
 * The context window of the model the USER has selected, used as the fallback
 * limit wherever a session has not reported one yet.
 *
 * `CONTEXT_LIMIT` (1M) was a fixed assumption: a session with no assistant turn
 * yet, or one whose transcript names no model, rendered its context row against
 * a million tokens no matter which model was picked — a 256K model read as 8%
 * of a window it does not have. The composer's own pick is the only honest
 * answer available before a turn exists, and it is already persisted for the
 * scheduled-task runner (`omp_selected_model`), so both readers share one
 * source.
 *
 * Returns null when nothing is stored or the pick no longer resolves against
 * the live registry (a removed model, a disabled provider); callers then keep
 * the historical constant rather than inventing a window.
