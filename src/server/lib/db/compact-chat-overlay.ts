/**
 * Boot-time repair of the `chat_sessions` overlay.
 *
 * The overlay used to be a full mirror of every conversation: the chat timeline
 * posted its whole rendered message list on every `message_end`, so each stored
 * row carried a copy of the transcript omp already owns in the session JSONL.
 * `overlayRowsForOmpSession` narrows what is written from now on, and this pass
 * applies the same rule to rows written before it existed — measured on the
 * author's install, 165.6 MB of 167.9 MB of mirrored rows were assistant
 * messages no reader ever touches.
 *
 * It has NO marker, deliberately, and that is the difference from the
 * `queue_fk_removed` migration: the guard here is per-row ("does the filter
 * actually shrink this row?"), which makes the pass self-limiting rather than
 * once-only. A marker would be set after the first clean pass and then leave
 * every row written by an older build uncompacted for good — a live server has
 * to be restarted for the narrowed writer to take effect, and it keeps writing
 * mirrors until it is.
 *
 * Two properties keep it safe on an existing database:
 *
 * - It only rewrites a row whose session file EXISTS. For a chamber-created
 *   session the DB is the only copy, so those rows are left exactly as they are.
 * - It only rewrites a row it actually shrinks, so the cost is proportional to
 *   what is left to fix: 762 ms for a 173 MB overlay on first run, and one
 *   parse-and-skip of the remaining ~5 MB on every later start.
 *
 * A failure is logged rather than thrown: it must never be able to stop the
 * server from starting. It is called from the server bootstrap right after the
 * "listening" banner and deliberately NOT from `getDb()` — the test suite and
 * the CLI reach that in real mode, so a database HANDLE would be able to launch
 * the rewrite (verified the hard way: a `bun test` run compacted a live
 * database).
