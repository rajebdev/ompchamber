/**
 * Bootstrap-only folder ↔ omp project sync: creates a workspace folder for
 * every project discovered from ~/.omp/agent (folder name = lowercase
 * basename, bound via project_path). It never modifies or deletes existing
 * user data — no renames, no re-binding of unbound folders — and it skips
 * projects the user has explicitly deleted (tombstoned in
 * `deleted_workspaces`), so a deleted workspace stays deleted.
 *
 * **It runs ONLY while the workspace list is empty, and only ONCE per
 * database.** The list is the user's own grouping over omp projects, so a
 * non-empty one means the user (or an earlier boot) has already decided what
 * belongs there and the sync has nothing left to seed — it steps aside. The
 * once-per-database marker covers the other half of that: an empty list is
 * also what a user who deleted every folder leaves behind, and without the
 * marker the next boot refilled all 43 of them.
 *
 * This gate is what stops the phantom-workspace churn. The sync's input is
 * every session file under `~/.omp/agent/sessions`, and a session's cwd is
 * whatever directory omp was spawned in: on the machine this was written for,
 * 556 session files carried 43 distinct cwds, and 33 of them were scratch
 * directories (`/tmp/omp-*`, `/var/folders/.../T/opencode/*`, `$HOME` itself).
 * Each one that appeared *after* the list had been curated became a new folder
 * on the next boot — the delete only tombstones the paths it saw, so the next
 * scratch directory is a fresh insert. The user deleted 88 of them before this
 * gate existed, 13 of those in a single minute.
