/**
 * The workspace sync is a one-time BOOTSTRAP, and its gate is the whole point.
 *
 * The sync's input is every session file under `~/.omp/agent/sessions`, and a
 * session's cwd is whatever directory omp was spawned in — scratch directories
 * included. Without the gate, every scratch cwd that appeared after the user
 * had curated their sidebar became a new workspace folder on the next boot, and
 * deleting one only tombstoned the paths it had seen. Measured on the machine
 * this was written for: 556 session files, 43 distinct cwds, 33 of them scratch
 * (`/tmp/omp-*`, `/var/folders/.../T/opencode/*`, `$HOME`), and 88 folders the
 * user had already deleted.
 *
 * Two properties are pinned here, because each fails silently on its own:
 *
 * - a NON-EMPTY list is never appended to (the gate), and
 * - an EMPTY list is still seeded (the gate is not a no-op).
 *
 * `PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR` is read per call, so pointing it at a temp directory is
 * enough to redirect discovery — the same seam `blobs.server.test.ts` uses.
