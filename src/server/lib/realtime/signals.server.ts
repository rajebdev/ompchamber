 *
 * The indirection exists to keep the dependency arrow pointing one way. The
 * modules that WRITE the state (`stream-state.server.ts`, `delete.server.ts`)
 * live below the realtime layer and must not import it — doing so would make
 * `topics.server.ts` → `sidebar-data.server.ts` → `stream-state.server.ts` →
 * `topics.server.ts` a cycle. They raise a signal instead, and the realtime
 * layer subscribes at init.
 *
 * This module deliberately imports nothing, so it can sit under any of them.
