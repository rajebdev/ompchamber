/**
 * The `session:<id>` topic: one session's live state and its agent frames.
 *
 * The snapshot is `buildAgentSnapshot` — the SAME builder `GET
 * /api/agent/:sessionId` answers from. A session owned by ANOTHER instance is
 * the exception the route also makes: the owner's own payload is forwarded,
 * because this process holds no child and its local builder can only answer
 * `{running:false}`. Without that forward the two surfaces disagree for one
 * question — the HTTP probe says `running:true` (forwarded) while the topic
 * says `false` (local) — and a tab on this instance shows a session that is
 * streaming with a timeline that never moves.
 *
 * `attach` binds the child's event fanout while anyone is watching, which is
 * what makes the topic push frames instead of every client holding a socket per
 * session. A session with no live child resolves to `{running:false}` and then
 * publishes nothing — correct, because there is no run to report. The spawn path
 * calls `publishSessionState` once the child exists, which re-snapshots this
 * topic for every subscriber.
