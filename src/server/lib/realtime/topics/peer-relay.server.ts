/**
 * Peer bridging for a session topic: relaying a session's frames from the
 * chamber instance that OWNS it into this instance's hub.
 *
 * Both instances share a database and an agent dir, so the owner's stream IS
 * this session's stream, and the client stays on whichever instance it opened
 * instead of being sent to another port.
 *
 * The relay dials the owner's UNIFIED realtime socket and subscribes this
 * session's topic on it. That is the only wire that carries a session's frames
 * now: the per-session agent socket (`/api/agent/<id>/ws`) was deleted with the
 * realtime migration, so a relay aimed at it reached a 404 and no frame ever
 * arrived — while the topic's own resolver also answered `{running:false}`
 * locally, so a tab on this instance rendered a streaming session as idle.
 *
 * Reconnection is the owner's business: this bridge does not retry, because a
 * silently reconnected relay would hide the owner being gone.
