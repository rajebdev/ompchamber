/**
 * The `usage` topic's payload SHAPE, and its agreement with the HTTP route.
 *
 * The right panel renders `usage.data ?? fetched` — one report, two read paths.
 * The topic resolved the provider ROWS while the route answered the report
 * ENVELOPE, so `buildProviders(report)` ran `report.providers.map` on
 * `undefined` and the panel threw `Cannot read properties of undefined
 * (reading 'map')` on open. A shape mismatch here is not a stale reading; it is
 * a crash, which is why both paths go through `buildUsageReport`.
 *
 * MOCK is forced on so the assertion needs no credential, no omp child and no
 * network — the shape is what is under test, not the probe.
