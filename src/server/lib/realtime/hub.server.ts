/**
 * The chamber's realtime hub: the one place a server-originated event enters,
 * and the one place it leaves from. Every publisher calls
 * `publish(topic, payload)`; every subscriber is a WebSocket connection from
 * `@/server/routes/realtime/ws`. Nothing else fans out to clients.
 *
 * A snapshot is BUFFERED, not just sent: it is produced by an async resolver,
 * so there is a window between "subscribed" and "its snapshot exists".
 * Registering after the resolve loses a delta that lands inside that window;
 * registering before it without buffering hands the client `delta seq 7` ahead
 * of `snapshot seq 5`. The order is register → note `seq` → resolve → send the
 * snapshot stamped with that `seq` → replay the deltas published meanwhile.
 * `seq` is contiguous per topic, which is what lets a client detect a gap and
 * ask for `resync` instead of sitting on stale data.
 *
 * Concurrent subscribers share one resolve; a later one starts a fresh resolve
 * rather than a cached answer, because caching would reintroduce the staleness
 * this transport exists to remove.
 *
 * State is anchored on `globalThis` for the reason the database handle is:
 * `bun --hot` re-evaluates this module while the sockets it serves live on, so a
 * module-level binding would orphan every connection's subscription.
