/**
 * Shared lifecycle for the chamber's observer WebSocket streams (agent events,
 * BTW frames). Both routes hand-rolled the same connection state — an
 * unsubscribe slot, a ping/pong keepalive, a latest-wins coalescer, and a
 * teardown that releases all three — so the policy lives here once, exactly as
 * `createSseStream` and `createEventCoalescer` own the SSE side.
 *
 * **Per-connection state must live on `ws.data`, never in a `WeakMap` keyed by
 * the `ws` object.** Elysia's Bun adapter constructs a NEW `ElysiaWS` wrapper
 * for every callback and hands `pong` the RAW `ServerWebSocket` rather than a
 * wrapper at all (verified on 1.4.30: `open` receives `ElysiaWS`, `pong`
 * receives the raw socket, and a `WeakMap` lookup in either misses). A missed
 * `pong` lookup never clears `awaitingPong`, so the second heartbeat tears down
 * a socket the client is still reading — every observer stream died at 60s
 * (measured: a fresh chamber instance closed a healthy socket at 60.005ms with
 * `STREAM_HEARTBEAT_MS` = 30s). A missed `close` lookup leaks the interval, the
 * coalescer and the session subscription for the process's lifetime.
 *
 * `ws.data` is one object shared by every callback, so it is the only stable
 * key. The routes keep their own store object in it and pass it here.
