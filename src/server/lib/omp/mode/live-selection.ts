/**
 * The plan/goal selection of a session that is ALIVE but has no transcript yet.
 *
 * omp writes the session JSONL at its first ASSISTANT message, not at spawn, so
 * a new chat spends its first seconds-to-minutes with a live child and no file.
 * During that window the file-based read has nothing to answer from, and the
 * console's hydration (`useChatTimelineModes`) treats the resulting 404 as
 * "no modes" — which resets the very toggles the user just pressed. Measured on
 * a real spawn: the file appeared 40 s after the id was adopted, so a Plan
 * toggle made in between was undone in the composer while the child was
 * demonstrably in plan mode.
 *
 * Two sources answer for the child, and neither can drift from it:
 *
 *  - the wrapper's `ModeMirror`, fed by the extension's own `CHAMBER_*` markers
 *    and by omp's `goal_updated`;
 *  - the spawn environment (`CHAMBER_MODES`), which is the selection the child
 *    was started with and which its extension re-applies at session start.
 *
 * `spoken` says whether the child itself has reported a mode. It is what the
 * caller uses to decide between these and a transcript that already exists:
 * the child's word is newer than any entry the file holds (a toggle moves the
 * child, and the append that records it lands a moment later), while an
 * unreported child is described better by the file than by the environment it
 * happened to be spawned with.
