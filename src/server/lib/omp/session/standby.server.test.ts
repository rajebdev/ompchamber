 * The standby-recycle contract, which is what makes an `omp update` visible
 * without a chamber restart.
 *
 * Three properties are load-bearing:
 *
 * - **Both pools are recycled**, and a failure in one does not skip the other —
 *   a pool that refuses to dispose is worse reported than left stale alongside
 *   a second stale pool.
 * - **The caches are dropped even when a pool reports nothing**, because a
 *   cached model/provider list served after the recycle makes the recycle look
 *   like it did nothing.
 * - **A burst coalesces onto one pass**, since an update and a button click can
 *   arrive together.
 *
 * The deps are injected rather than mocked through `mock.module`: swapping a
 * registry entry leaks into every other suite in the same `bun test` run.
