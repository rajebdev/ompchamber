/**
 * Refresh the plugin/skill inventory of every LIVE omp process the chamber
 * drives: the per-session children AND the pooled utility processes.
 *
 * omp discovers skills, commands and plugins once per process and does not
 * watch the filesystem, so a SKILL.md written while a session runs is invisible
 * to that session until it restarts. `/reload-plugins` is the only refresh omp
 * exposes, and it is reachable as a prompt because the builtin has a text-mode
 * `handle`. Verified on 18.4.3: it answers `agentInvoked: false` (no model
 * turn), leaves the session file byte-identical, and emits
 * `available_commands_update`.
 *
 * EVERY live process is refreshed, including a BUSY one. That is the correction
 * this module now carries: the previous version skipped `session.isBusy()`
 * sessions on the theory that a prompt dispatched into a running turn is a
 * queue insert. Measured on 18.4.3, it is not — a `/reload-plugins` sent
 * mid-turn is answered from omp's command loop in 16-40 ms with the turn still
 * streaming, the turn then completes normally, and the new skill is listed
 * immediately. (A PLAIN mid-turn prompt is dropped outright rather than
 * queued: the same run showed one `agent_start` for two prompts, so the "queue
 * insert" this guard feared is not what omp does with either kind.)
 *
 * The guard was actively harmful, because the common case IS a busy session:
 * the `create-skill` skill writes its SKILL.md with a tool WHILE the chat that
 * invoked it is streaming, so the write landed during a run and the refresh was
 * skipped — leaving the new skill invisible until the user found the manual `⟳`
 * button. Verified against a live chamber: a skill created mid-turn was absent
 * from `get_available_commands` after the turn ended, and appeared the moment a
 * session reloaded.
 *
 * A parked ask/approval dialog is no obstacle either (measured: `get_state`,
 * `get_available_commands` and `/reload-plugins` all answered within 16 ms with
 * a blocking `select` pending, because omp services the RPC command loop
 * independently of the turn waiting on the dialog).
 *
 * The two sources are injected so the policy is testable without patching
 * modules — see `reload.server.test.ts`. Best-effort throughout: one child
 * failing never blocks the others.
