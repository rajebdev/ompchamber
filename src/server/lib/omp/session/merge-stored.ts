 * (`@agent` → a task-tool delegation prompt, `/skill:a b` → `/skill:a`) and
 * writes no user entry at all for `/command` turns. The chamber DB keeps the
 * turn as the user typed it, which is what this restores.
 *
 * Attachments are UNIONED rather than picked from one side. The two sources see
 * different halves of the same attachment:
 *
 * - The JSONL recovers a text file's NAME from the delivered prompt (the
 *   composer inlines the file as `Attached file: <name>` plus a fenced block)
 *   and carries an image's bytes, but has no preview and no stored content.
 * - The chamber row has the display fields — a text file's name and content, an
 *   image's name and preview — but nothing about what omp actually received.
 *
 * Choosing one list over the other is what made a dropped `.md`/`.py`/`.json`
 * vanish from a reloaded session: the JSONL had an image, so its list won, and
 * the text file only ever existed in the chamber row.

 * no JSONL user turn relates to is positioned by its own clock
 * (`anchorIndexFor`), not by scanning the stored array for a row the JSONL still
 * carries — which is what makes this narrowing self-sufficient rather than a
 * change that quietly moves a `/usage` or `/compact` bubble to the end of the
 * timeline. Verified against this install's own files: of 260 stored sessions
 * compared against their JSONLs, only the turns whose anchor the scan had been
 * supplying change position, and they change to the time they were sent.
