/**
 * Read one session's todo state from its transcript.
 *
 * The list is omp's, and its only durable home is the session JSONL — there is
 * no separate todo file and no chamber-side copy to fall out of date. So the
 * read is: locate the session file, parse it, and take the deepest committed
 * snapshot on the active branch (`latestTodoSnapshot`).
 *
 * Two properties of this read are deliberate:
 *
 *   - **It is a full-file parse, cached by size+mtime.** Measured on real
 *     sessions (7.2 MB / 1905 entries) a full parse is ~15 ms, and the todos
 *     may sit megabytes from EOF — a `todo` call near the start of a long
 *     session stays the live list for the rest of it, so a bounded tail window
 *     would report "no todos" for exactly the sessions that have the most. omp
 *     flushes each entry as it appends, so a poll sees a new list within the
 *     second it was written.
 *   - **It never creates an omp process.** The session is read-only here; a
 *     panel that spawned a child per poll would fight the chat's own session
 *     wrapper for the same session file.
