/**
 * The raw output behind an `artifact://<id>` reference.
 *
 * When a tool result is too long to keep inline omp spills the whole stream to
 * a file beside the session and leaves a `columnTruncated.artifactId` in the
 * result's `details.meta` — measured over 5,441 real results, 1% (65) carry one,
 * and they are exactly the outputs a reader most wants whole: a `bash` build
 * log, an `eval` that printed a table, a `read` of a long file. The chamber
 * served none of it, so those results were truncated at 768 bytes with no way
 * to see the rest.
 *
 * The layout is omp's own, verified against a real install:
 *   <sessionsDir>/<cwd-dir>/<sessionFile>.jsonl        the transcript
 *   <sessionsDir>/<cwd-dir>/<sessionId>/<id>.<kind>.log the spilled stream
 * `kind` is the tool's own (`bash`, `bash-original`, `eval`, `read`, `async`),
 * and the id is numeric.
 *
 * Every guard here is a path boundary: the id must be digits, the kind must be
 * one of omp's own, and the resolved path must still sit inside the session's
 * directory. omp wrote these files, but the id and kind reach this module from
 * a session transcript, which is a document the chamber reads rather than one
 * it wrote.
