/**
 * Auto session titles for OMPChamber.
 *
 * Chamber spawns omp with `--mode rpc-ui`, and that mode force-sets
 * `PI_NO_TITLE=1` (omp's main.ts). The flag gates only the two AUTOMATIC title
 * paths — `AgentSession.maybeStartTitleGeneration` (first user message) and
 * `#scheduleReplanTitleRefresh` (todo replan) — so a chamber session is never
 * named on its own and the sidebar keeps the `New Session - <timestamp>`
 * placeholder for its whole life.
 *
 * The generate path itself is NOT gated: `/rename` with no args reaches
 * `session.generateTitle()` through `executeAcpBuiltinSlashCommand`, which
 * rpc-mode dispatches for a `prompt` frame BEFORE that frame is forwarded as a
 * turn — so the request can be sent at any point in a run and never becomes
 * part of the conversation. Verified against omp 18.3.0 — the ack returns
 * `{agentInvoked:false}` immediately, the generation lands ~3-4s later as
 * `session_info_update` + `command_output`, and no entry is written to the
 * transcript.
 *
 * WHY THE NAME MUST BE EMPTY FIRST: `/rename` persists through
 * `setSessionName(title, "user")`. omp's own guard only refuses an `"auto"`
 * write over a `"user"` title, so a `/rename` fired against an already-named
 * session would overwrite the operator's own name. The unnamed check below is
 * therefore a safety property, not a nicety — it is re-read from `get_state`
 * on every attempt rather than cached, so a rename made in another tab is
 * respected.
 *
 * ONE ATTEMPT PER CONVERSATION, RETRIED ONCE INSIDE THE FIRST RUN. The title
 * is derived from the FIRST run and never re-asked after it. omp's `/rename`
 * derives its title from the newest turns (and `generateRenameTitle` reserves a
 * fresh title revision, which cancels any generation still in flight), so a
 * second attempt after turn two would name the session after whatever the
 * conversation had become by then — and could even discard a slow first
 * generation.
 *
 * There are exactly two triggers, both inside that first run:
 *
 *   1. the first settled USER message — the earliest point at which the
 *      transcript carries the conversation's opening intent. (`agent_start` is
 *      too early to be usable: omp pushes it before the turn opens, so the
 *      transcript is still empty there and the title context comes back blank.
 *      See the `message_end` branch of frame-fold.)
 *   2. the terminal `agent_end`, as a fallback when the early attempt produced
 *      no title — a provider error, a timeout, a child that went away, or the
 *      tiny model declining.
 *
 * The eligibility latch `autoTitlePending` is consumed by the fallback, so that
 * is the last chance this conversation gets and a later run can never title it.
 * `autoTitleRequested` is what keeps the early trigger from firing again on a
 * queued steer message. A session that a skill invocation opened has no
 * user-role message at all (omp delivers it as a `custom` message), so the
 * early trigger never fires there and the fallback is what names it.
 *
 * A first message that omp's low-signal filter rejects ("hi") therefore leaves
 * the session unnamed for good, which is the honest outcome: the fallback does
 * re-ask, and omp declines a second time (measured on omp 18.3.0 — the
 * rejection is a property of the opening message, not of when it is asked).
