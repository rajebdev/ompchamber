/**
 * Cross-process session ownership: who else is writing this session file, and
 * which chamber instance owns that writer.
 *
 * ## Why this exists
 *
 * omp 18.5.0 introduced a per-session ownership lease
 * (`~/.omp/run/session-owners/<id>.lock`, an OS `flock` held for the life of
 * the omp process that opened the session). A second omp process that resumes a
 * file whose lease is already held is NOT allowed to mix its entries in: it
 * moves itself to a sibling file with a new session id and `parentSession`
 * pointing at the old one (`reason: "open-elsewhere"`).
 *
 * The chamber's own registry (`globalThis.__ompSessions`) is PER PROCESS, so
 * `startRpcSession` cannot see a session a second chamber instance is already
 * running. Resuming that file is exactly the case omp forks — the user sees a
 * duplicate sidebar row with the same title (both files share the opening
 * message), and their conversation is split across two files.
 *
 * Verified by reproduction: one chamber instance running a session, a second
 * instance sending a prompt to the same id, and omp logging
 * `Session moved to a new file … open-elsewhere` within a second.
 *
 * ## Two questions, both answered without a subprocess
 *
 *   - "Is the lease held?" — a non-blocking `flock` (`lease-flock.server.ts`),
 *     the same primitive omp takes.
 *   - "Who holds it?" — the pid with an open descriptor on the lease file,
 *     found by walking the process table (`lease-holder.server.ts`, FFI on
 *     macOS, `/proc` on Linux). This is what `lsof -t` answers, asked directly.
 *
 * The holder's PARENT is then matched against the chamber's instance records:
 * an omp child is spawned by a server, so its parent IS the instance a client
 * must be relayed to. That also tells a foreign writer from this process's own
 * child (a stale registry entry is parented by us).
