/**
 * Reading the chamber's persisted mode selection back off a session.
 *
 * The extension appends one `custom` entry per mode transition
 * (`chamber-plan-state`, `chamber-goal-state`), so the session's own JSONL is
 * the durable record — and it is the only one that survives a chamber restart,
 * a second chamber instance, and a session the CLI itself has been driving.
 *
 * Reading it is a full parse of the same records the transcript loader already
 * walks (`loadSessionMessages`), so this module shares the lenient JSONL
 * reader rather than opening a second, differently-behaved one. Only the LAST
 * record of each type matters: the entries are a transition log, and the newest
 * one is the state the session was left in.
