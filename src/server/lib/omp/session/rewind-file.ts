/**
 * The JSONL surgery and overlay pruning behind the in-place rewind endpoint,
 * split from the route so both can be exercised without a live session file.
 *
 * A rewind truncates the session file back to just before a USER TURN. Two
 * record shapes carry one, and both must be accepted:
 *
 *  - `type: "message"` with `message.role: "user"` — an ordinary prompt;
 *  - `type: "custom_message"` with `customType: "skill-prompt"` — omp expands
 *    `/skill:<name>` into a custom record and writes NO user message for it, so
 *    a skill turn had no valid cut point at all: the route answered
 *    `entry_not_found` (400) and the Undo button did nothing.
 *
 * A cut point is not always IN the file, either. A builtin command (`/usage`,
 * `/compact`, `/context`) writes no entry at all, so the timeline row the user
 * clicks exists only in the chamber DB and carries a client-side id
 * (`msg-…-user`). The row is positioned by its own clock, so a cut named by
 * such an id resolves to the first FILE turn at or after it — and the rows the
 * cut removed are reported back so the overlay can drop them too. Missing that
 * second half is what resurrected an undone turn on the next reload.
