/**
 * The goal loop's driver: the chamber asks the AUDITOR after every turn and
 * obeys the verdict.
 *
 * Ownership moved here from the child's extension deliberately. The extension
 * can see ceilings and budgets but not whether the objective was met, so with
 * the loop inside the child the only termination authority was the working
 * agent's own word. An independent auditor is a model call, which the child
 * cannot make — and the chamber is where the session's turn boundaries, the
 * persisted goal record and the client stream all meet.
 *
 * What stays in the child: opening the continuation TURN. Only the extension
 * can send the hidden message (`display:false`) that re-enters the loop without
 * leaving a user bubble, and it is also where the hard stops live (token
 * budget, autoturn ceiling). So the driver PACES the loop — `goal continue` —
 * and the extension either opens the next turn or reports why it will not.
 *
 * Failure handling follows OpenChamber's rule: one unchecked continuation is
 * allowed, a second consecutive audit failure stops the goal rather than
 * driving blind to the turn cap.
