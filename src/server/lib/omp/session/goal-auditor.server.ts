/**
 * The goal progress check: an INDEPENDENT auditor, asked after every turn.
 *
 * Why a separate call and not the working agent's own word: an agent that
 * judges its own completion can settle a goal it has not finished, and the
 * guard chain the loop used before could only see ceilings and budgets — never
 * whether the objective had actually been met. The audit is the termination
 * authority; the loop merely obeys it.
 *
 * The check is three yes/no questions about the agent's OWN REPORT (the last
 * assistant message), answered from the objective alone — no conversation
 * history, which is why an objective has to be self-contained. The questions
 * mirror OpenChamber's `packages/web/server/lib/session-goal/audit.js`: their
 * wording is measured against a labelled set of goal turns, so it is worth
 * keeping the shape of the three (`all_done`, `remaining`, `needs_user`) and
 * the decision table that reads them.
 *
 * Transport: a one-shot `omp -p --no-session --no-tools` with the prompt on
 * stdin — the same print mode this repo's own bot scripts use. A process per
 * audit costs a spawn, and that is the point: the audit is a model call, so the
 * window it occupies is real time the UI can honestly report as "evaluating".
