/**
 * Watch omp's sessions directory and announce structural change to the sidebar.
 *
 * A session FILE appearing is what makes a session visible in the sidebar, and
 * omp writes it only when the first assistant message settles (~17s on a plain
 * prompt, because its writes are buffered). Nothing else reports that moment:
 * the chamber's own writes cover spawn adoption, rename and delete, but the
 * file itself is omp's.
 *
 * The 30s idle poll this replaces existed for exactly this case, plus changes
 * made by another tab or a CLI-driven session. Both are covered here and by the
 * writes that go through the chamber, so the poll is gone.
 *
 * Two rules keep it cheap and correct:
 *
 *   - **One watcher, recursive, on the sessions root.** Its subdirectories are
 *     per-cwd, created as sessions appear; a per-directory watcher set would
 *     have to be re-synced on every mkdir.
 *   - **A burst collapses into one publish.** omp writes a session through
 *     several syscalls (temp file, rename, the entry), and a run's transcript
 *     grows continuously — so the filter is the FILE EXTENSION that matters
 *     (`.jsonl`, not the `.probe-*` scratch files omp leaves beside them), and
 *     the debounce is what keeps a streaming write from republishing the
 *     sidebar on every append.
 *
 * The handle is anchored on `globalThis` for the reason the database and the
 * terminal store are: `bun --hot` re-evaluates this module while the watcher
 * lives on, and a module-level binding would orphan it with no way to close it.
