/**

 *
 * File mtime is NOT that value. A title-slot rename rewrites the first 256
 * bytes in place and bumps mtime without a turn having happened; a full-file
 * title rewrite on a slot-less legacy file does the same; and a session
 * restored or copied from a backup carries an mtime unrelated to its content.
 * Every one of those moved the sidebar's `LATEST_SESSION` order. The last
 * entry's own `timestamp` is what "latest session" means, and it survives all
 * three.
 *
 * Process bookkeeping does not count either — see LIFECYCLE_CUSTOM_TYPES.
 *
 * `prefix` is the already-read 4 KiB head; a file that fits inside it needs no
 * second read — a third of the sessions on a real machine are that small.
 *
 * The window starts at SESSION_TAIL_BYTES and widens toward
 * SESSION_TAIL_MAX_BYTES while it holds no usable entry, so a session ending
 * on one oversized entry is still dated correctly. Only when even the ceiling
 * holds nothing but lifecycle markers — an empty file, or a single entry
 * larger than a megabyte — does this return undefined and let the caller fall
 * back to mtime.
