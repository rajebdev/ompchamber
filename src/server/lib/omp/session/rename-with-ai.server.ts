/**
 * "Rename with AI" — the session row's menu action that asks omp to name a
 * conversation from its own transcript.
 *
 * It is the MANUAL counterpart of the chamber's auto-titling
 * (`auto-title.server.ts`), and the difference is the whole point: auto-titling
 * refuses to touch a session that already has a name, because it fires
 * unrequested and would overwrite what the operator typed. This action IS the
 * request, so it renames regardless — verified against a real omp child:
 * `/rename` fired at a session explicitly named "MY DELIBERATE NAME" returned
 * "PostgreSQL connection pool in Rust".
 *
 * Everything else is shared with auto-titling, including the two omp facts it
 * is built on (both re-verified here on omp 18.3.x):
 *
 *   - `/rename` with no args is dispatched by rpc-mode BEFORE the prompt frame
 *     becomes a turn, so it is background work: the ack is `{agentInvoked:false}`
 *     and nothing is appended to the transcript. Sending it through the
 *     wrapper's `send()` would instead mark the session streaming and flash the
 *     sidebar's run badge, so it goes straight to the process.
 *   - omp answers with `session_info_update` (the new title) then
 *     `command_output` ("Session renamed to …", or "Could not generate a
 *     session title" when the transcript is too thin). The frames carry no
 *     correlation id, so the wrapper's request WINDOW is what keeps the
 *     diagnostics out of the timeline — the same mechanism auto-titling uses,
 *     and the reason `markTitleRequestSent` is called here too.
 *
 * The route awaits the outcome rather than firing and forgetting: the caller
 * has to be told either the new name or why none was produced, and a title
 * generation takes a few seconds.
