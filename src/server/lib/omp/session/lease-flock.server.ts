/**
 * Is a session's omp ownership lease held by another process?
 *
 * omp takes an OS `flock` on `<session-owners>/<id>.lock` for the life of the
 * omp process that opened the session (`tryAcquireSessionLease`). Asking
 * "is it held" is therefore a `flock` question, and this asks it with the same
 * primitive rather than shelling out to `lsof`.
 *
 * ## Why not a subprocess
 *
 * `lsof -t <file>` answers the same question, but it costs a process spawn plus
 * a full descriptor-table scan — the exact cost `libproc`/`/proc` exist in
 * `lifecycle/proc` to avoid (measured there: 32 ms for a spawn against 0.001 ms
 * for a direct call). A spawn at spawn-time also makes the guard's own failure
 * mode worse: an exhausted descriptor table fails `lsof` the same way it fails
 * the omp spawn it was meant to protect.
 *
 * ## The probe acquires, briefly
 *
 * `flock` has no "test without taking". The probe takes `LOCK_EX | LOCK_NB`,
 * which fails IMMEDIATELY (never blocks) when another holder exists, and
 * releases at once when it succeeds. The window in which this process holds the
 * lock is microseconds, and only ever when the lease was free — the same
 * acquire-and-release omp itself performs, so no new race is introduced.
 *
 * A missing lease file is NOT "unknown": omp creates it on the first claim and
 * never deletes it, so its absence means the session was never claimed — free.
