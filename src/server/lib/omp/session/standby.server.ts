/**
 * Recycle the omp processes that stand by for a chat nobody has started yet.
 *
 * Two pools hold a process with no session and no turn — the shared utility
 * children (`--no-session --no-lsp`, answering `get_available_models`,
 * `get_login_providers`, `get_available_commands`) and the per-cwd prewarm
 * entries (an idle session host waiting to be adopted by the next send). Both
 * are spawned ONCE and then live for minutes: the utility pool is idle-killed
 * after 5 minutes and a prewarm waits for a send that may be an hour away.
 *
 * That longevity is what makes a binary replacement invisible. `omp update`
 * swaps the launcher and the package on disk, but a child already running is
 * the old build for its whole life, so the provider list, the model list and
 * the composer's `/` popup keep answering from the previous version. The
 * per-session children are the same story with a longer fuse — a session can
 * sit idle for ten minutes before its own timer reclaims it.
 *
 * So a reload here means DISPOSE, not `/reload-plugins`: a fresh child is the
 * only thing that reads the new binary, and "no child" is a state both pools
 * already handle by design (lazy start). `/reload-plugins` re-reads skill and
 * plugin FILES inside a live process and would leave the old binary running —
 * see `reload.server.ts` for that, which is a different question.
 *
 * Every live SESSION is deliberately untouched: it may be mid-turn, and its
 * `--resume` on the next command already boots the current binary. The two
 * pools below are the ones whose staleness the user can see and cannot fix.
 *
 * Sources are injected so the policy is testable without patching modules —
 * see `standby.server.test.ts`.
