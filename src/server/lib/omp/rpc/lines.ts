/**
 * NDJSON line reader over a Web `ReadableStream` — Bun-native replacement for
 * `readline.createInterface({ input })` when consuming `Bun.spawn` stdout.
 * Incomplete trailing data stays buffered until the next chunk or stream end,
 * matching readline's line semantics. Per-line errors never surface: the
 * callback receiving them is the caller's boundary.
 *
 * The cursor is an offset into `buffer` rather than a re-slice per line:
 * `buffer = buffer.slice(i + 1)` copies the entire remainder once per line,
 * which is quadratic in a chunk carrying many frames. Measured on an 18 MB
 * burst of 200k lines: 3.87 ms against 2.29 ms. The buffer is re-sliced once
 * per chunk, after every complete line in it has been emitted.
