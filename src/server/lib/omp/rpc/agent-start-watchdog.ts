/**
 * Watchdog for a dispatch whose turn never opened.
 *
 * The command dispatcher marks `stream` and arms `awaitingAgentStartDeadline`
 * the moment a prompt is sent, because omp may accept it and open no turn at
 * all — a builtin it runs itself, or a prompt it drops. It then relies on a
 * frame to settle that state: `agent_start` for a real run, `prompt_result` for
 * one that never started. When NO such frame ever arrives nothing settles it:
 *
 *   - `promptRunning` stays true, so `isRunning()` stays true, so the idle
 *     reaper refuses to reclaim the child and `GET /api/agent/:id` reports
 *     `busy` forever;
 *   - the `stream` row is owned by a LIVE process, so
 *     `healStaleStreamStatuses` cannot reach it either — the sidebar spinner
 *     turns until the process restarts.
 *
 * Measured shape: the chamber's own `/chamber-mode` extension (the composer's
 * Plan/Goal toggles) acks a bare `{success:true}`, which reads as a run.
 *
 * The deadline is the only thing that can tell this apart from a slow start,
 * and nothing was watching it. This watches it.
 *
 * The decision is a callback because "did it actually settle?" is a question
 * only the wrapper can answer — the same split as `IdleReaper`, and for the
 * same reason: this object owns only the clock.
