/**
 * Ask one live omp child to re-read its skill/command/plugin roots.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT routed through `dispatchSessionCommand`: that path owns the
 * turn state machine (`promptRunning`, the stream row, queue delivery) because
 * a prompt it dispatches is a USER TURN. `/reload-plugins` is not a turn —
 * omp answers `agentInvoked: false`, writes nothing to the transcript (verified
 * on 18.4.3: a session file is byte-identical across a reload), and answers it
 * from its command loop even while a turn streams. Measured: ack in 16-40 ms
 * during a live turn AND while a blocking approval dialog was parked, with the
 * turn completing normally afterwards and the new skill listed immediately.
 * Going through the prompt path would flip a busy session to "starting a run"
 * — the one state a reload must not disturb.
 *
 * Returns false when the child is gone; a missing ack is still a success (an
 * older omp accepts the command without echoing `agentInvoked`).
