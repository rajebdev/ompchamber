/**
 * Folds one omp RPC frame into the session wrapper's runtime state.
 *
 * Mirrors the client's `foldAgentEvent` (shared/lib/chat/omp/agent-events.ts):
 * the same shape of problem — one frame, many state flags — solved the same way
 * so both ends of the transport read alike. Split out of rpc-manager.ts so the
 * wrapper owns only process lifecycle.
 *
 * The state machine is the load-bearing part. `turn_end` fires for EVERY turn
 * in a multi-turn run, `agent_end` is the only frame that knows whether the run
 * is terminal, and a `prompt` response that failed must clear the same flags a
 * successful settle does — a missed clear strands the session as "running" and
 * the idle reclaim can never take it back. What a terminal `agent_end` TRIGGERS
 * lives in `terminal-settle.ts`.

 * The `prompt_result` branch: whether this frame may reach the client.

 * after the first settled user message), a Plan/Goal mode toggle,
 * `/reload-plugins`, `rename-with-ai`, a peer instance's command. Forwarding one
 * tells the CLIENT that its prompt opened no turn; its fold then settles the
 * optimistic turn — blanking the docked generating indicator, releasing the
 * `stream` mark the sidebar's spinner hangs on and dropping the optimistic user
 * mark, so the turn's own echo is appended beside the bubble it stood for.
 * Measured on a fresh session (omp 18.7.0): the indicator died ~450 ms into a
 * 20 s run, and the first prompt was stored twice in the chamber's copy of the
 * conversation.
 *
 * The RUN is the attribution, and it covers every sender: while the operator's
 * turn is streaming, a prompt that opened no turn cannot be the settle of the
 * turn they are watching. The auto-title request window is not sufficient on its
 * own — it is armed around the `/rename`, and omp answers it in the same tick
 * (~3 ms), so a frame that won that race reached the client regardless (the leak
 * this replaces). Its flags are left alone too, exactly as the dispatcher leaves
 * a non-owning command's (see `session-commands.ts`): the live run owns them.
 *
 * A builtin the operator typed while the agent is IDLE still passes through
 * untouched — the case this frame exists for.
