/**
 * Peer forwarding: when a session is owned by ANOTHER chamber instance, serve
 * the request from that instance instead of starting a second omp writer.
 *
 * ## Why forward instead of redirect
 *
 * The ownership guard (ownership.server.ts) refuses to resume a session another
 * process owns, because omp moves the second writer to a sibling file
 * (`open-elsewhere`) — the duplicate sidebar rows and split conversations this
 * whole change exists to prevent. Redirecting the tab to the owner works, but
 * it moves the user to a different port mid-conversation.
 *
 * Forwarding keeps the client on whichever instance it opened: every
 * `/api/agent/:sessionId*` request for a peer-owned session is relayed to the
 * owning instance, which runs it against the ONE omp child it already has. Both
 * instances share a database and an agent dir, so the owner is authoritative
 * and no state needs reconciling.
 *
 * ## Loop safety
 *
 * A relayed request carries {@link PEER_HOP_HEADER}. A request that already has
 * it is never forwarded again: if two instances disagree about ownership (a
 * stale record, a lease released between the two checks), the second hop
 * answers with the ownership refusal instead of bouncing the request forever.
 *
 * ## Failure
 *
 * An unreachable peer (crashed, port reused) is not an error the user should
 * see as a hang: the caller falls back to the ownership refusal, and the client
 * still has the redirect path.
