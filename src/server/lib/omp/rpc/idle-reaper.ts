/**
 * The idle reclaim for one omp child.
 *
 * A wrapper keeps a process alive for as long as it is doing something and
 * reclaims it after a quiet window — but "doing something" is a question only
 * the wrapper can answer (a running turn, a parked approval dialog, a live
 * subagent), so the decision is a callback and this object owns only the clock.
 *
 * Two rules are load-bearing:
 *
 *  - **every frame defers the deadline**, which is why `reset` is called from
 *    the frame path and not from the command path alone: a long tool call emits
 *    no commands but plenty of frames;
 *  - **the deferral is coalesced** (`COALESCE_MS`). A streaming turn emits
 *    hundreds of frames a second, and re-arming a timer on each one is pure
 *    churn — the deadline only has to move once per quiet period.
