/**
 * The wrapper's mirror of omp's plan/goal modes.
 *
 * Two facts make a mirror necessary rather than a passthrough:
 *
 *  - `get_state` does not carry either mode, so a reattaching client (a reload,
 *    a second tab) has nothing to read the mode from;
 *  - and the mode is not a client preference — it decides whether the child is
 *    running a goal the chamber must keep feeding, and whether a plan is parked
 *    waiting for a human.
 *
 * The mirror is fed by two frames, and they cover different halves:
 *
 *  - omp's own `goal_updated` session event, which is authoritative for the
 *    goal: whatever the chamber last asked for, the frame reports what the
 *    child actually did;
 *  - the chamber extension's own `CHAMBER_*` notice markers, which are the ONLY
 *    live word on PLAN mode (omp emits no plan event at all) and the only place
 *    a goal RECORD — objective, status, continuation verdict — is carried.
 *
 * The second feed is what makes a session readable before its transcript
 * exists: omp writes the JSONL at the first assistant message, so for the first
 * seconds-to-minutes of a new chat the file-based read has nothing while the
 * child is demonstrably in the mode the user just picked. See
 * `liveModeSelection`.
