/**
 * What a TERMINAL `agent_end` does, split out of the frame fold.
 *
 * The fold is a switch over every frame type; this is the one branch with a
 * body long enough to be worth its own file, and it is the branch where a
 * missed step is invisible: a run that ends without clearing `streaming`
 * strands the session as "running", and the idle reclaim can never take it back.
 *
 * Three rules live here, and each was learned from a failure:
 *
 * - **An aborted run is not auditable and does not advance anything.** The
 *   operator stopped the turn, so the goal loop is not asked about a half-run
 *   transcript and the queued follow-up is held (stop-all semantics) until the
 *   next run end or an explicit send.
 * - **The title gets one last chance.** The early attempt fires on the first
 *   settled user message and can come back empty (provider error, timeout, a
 *   child that went away, the tiny model declining), and the run end is the
 *   last moment a title can still be derived from the conversation's OPENING
 *   turn. A later run names the session after whatever it had become by then.
 * - **The badge is written from this frame alone.** `turn_end` fires for every
 *   turn of a multi-turn run and carries no `isTerminal`, so it cannot say the
 *   run is over; `agent_end` is the only frame that knows.
