/**
 * Refuse a prompt that invokes a command omp implements only in its TUI, and

 *
 * This is the SERVER half of the guard in

 * path never passes through the composer: the follow-up queue's auto-delivery
 * calls `session.send({ type: 'prompt' })` directly from
 * `lib/queue/delivery.server.ts`. A `/plan` queued before a run would otherwise
 * be delivered to the model as literal text once the run ends.
 *
 * The refusal is framed as a real command result — a `command_output` notice
 * plus, for a non-streaming prompt, the `agentInvoked:false` ack — so the
 * client's existing fold renders the notice and settles the optimistic spinner
 * with no new protocol.
 *
 * `streaming` is the caller's own knowledge of whether a turn is running: a
 * steer of a refused command must not clear the flags of the turn it was aimed
 * at (omp runs `session.steer()` with no slash handling at all, so a steer of
 * `/plan` is exactly as meaningless as a fresh one).
 *
 * Returns true when the prompt was refused (the caller must not dispatch).
