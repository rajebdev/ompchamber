/**
 * Fan-out for one omp child's event stream.
 *
 * Split out of the session wrapper for the same reason `IdleReaper`,
 * `PendingUiDialogs` and `SubagentLiveness` were: the wrapper composes several
 * self-contained pieces, and this one owns exactly one rule — a throwing
 * subscriber must not starve the others. It sits on the frame path, so a
 * subscriber that throws (an SSE encode failure, a UI handler bug) would
 * otherwise abort the whole dispatch and silently drop every later listener.
 *
 * Insertion order is preserved, and unsubscribing is by identity, so a listener
 * added twice receives twice and each removal takes out one registration.
