/**
 * Settles a run omp no longer owns.
 *
 * A `stream` row is written at prompt dispatch and released by a terminal
 * `agent_end`. Two shapes break that contract, and both leave a session that
 * LOOKS finished while the sidebar spins and every client that opens it
 * resumes the generating indicator:
 *
 *   - omp ends the turn with `agent_end {isTerminal:false}` — a detached
 *     subagent, a background job, a queued continuation — and the continuation
 *     never arrives (the work it waited on went away). `streaming` then stays
 *     true for the life of the process.
 *   - the frame stream stops arriving for any other reason while the run is
 *     still open.
 *
 * Neither half of the sidebar heal can reach either shape: the row's owner is
 * THIS process and it is alive, so the staleness half sees a live pid, and the
 * orphan half only releases rows whose run this process does NOT hold — which
 * `isRunning()` says it does. `GET /api/agent/:id` cannot repair it either: a
 * busy session is answered from local flags precisely so a `get_state` cannot
 * queue up behind the running turn, so the one reconciler that reads omp's own
 * truth is never called. Measured on a real session that ended non-terminally:
 * the row survived 90s of sidebar loads, and the attach probe answered
 * `busy:true` the whole time.
 *
 * So the repair is a probe on omp's own quiescence verdict — `get_state
 * isSettled`, which is false while a run is streaming, admitted, scheduled,
 * queued or waiting on background work. Anything short of `true` changes
 * nothing (deliberately: the flags are only touched once the run is over, so a
 * mid-run probe can never blank a live run's state), and `isSettled === true`
 * settles the wrapper exactly the way a real end does.
 *
 * The clock (`RunSettle`) is fed by every frame and only probes after
 * `RUN_SILENCE_MS` of quiet; an announced retry wait (`auto_retry_start`'s
 * `delayMs`) pushes the deadline out by the wait omp itself promised, so a
 * provider retry is never mistaken for a strand.
 *
 * `handleChildExit` lives here too: an omp process that exits mid-run leaves
 * the same stranded row, and both paths are the "the run ended without a
 * terminal frame" story.
