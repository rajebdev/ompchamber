/**
 * The directories omp discovers skills and commands from.
 *
 * ONE table, because two consumers need the same answer and must not drift:
 * `locateCommandFile` (which file backs a command name) and the discovery
 * watcher (which directories to watch for a change). They were written
 * separately, and the watcher's copy was short by every root but the omp-native
 * pair — so a skill added to `.claude/skills`, `.codex/skills`, `.opencode`,
 * `.agents` or `.github` in a live session was never noticed.
 *
 * The set below is measured, not assumed (omp 18.4.3, a fresh directory with a
 * `SKILL.md` planted in each candidate and `omp skill list <dir> --json`):
 *
 *   project  .omp/skills     → native:project      ← the chamber may write here
 *            .claude/skills  → claude:project
 *            .codex/skills   → codex:project
 *            .agents/skills  → agents:project
 *            .opencode/skills→ opencode:project
 *            .github/skills  → github:project
 *
 *   user     ~/.omp/agent/skills → native:user      ← the chamber may write here
 *            ~/.agents/skills     → agents:user
 *
 * Everything else was verified NOT read at this level: `~/.claude/skills`,
 * `~/.codex/skills`, `~/.config/opencode/skills` and `~/.opencode/skills` are
 * all ignored by a child started in an unrelated cwd, even though omp does read
 * `~/.claude/commands` and friends for COMMANDS. Do not add a root here on the
 * strength of its command counterpart.
 *
 * Commands and skills share the project roots and the omp-native user root; the
 * registry-backed `~/.agents/skills` is skills-only. `.github` is skills-only
 * too — its command form is `.github/prompts/*.prompt.md`, a different layout
 * that `commands.ts` keeps its own entry for.
 *
 * A `managed` root is one the chamber may write to and delete from; every other
 * root is read-only here, because the chamber is not the tool that put the file
 * there.

 * of all four levels; adding an empty `.git` at `a/b` cut it to that level and

 * (a worktree or submodule) stops it just like a directory.
