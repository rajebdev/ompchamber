/**
 * Watch the skill/command roots omp reads and refresh every live child when one
 * of them changes.
 *
 * The chamber's own write path already reloads (settings/skills,
 * settings/commands), but that covers only writes it made. A SKILL.md can also
 * land from a hand edit, `git pull`, the `skills` CLI, another agent session, or
 * an editor — and omp discovers skills once per process, so a live child keeps
 * reporting the old inventory until it restarts. Verified against a live
 * chamber: a hand-written project skill was invisible to a running session, and
 * `/skill:<name>` reached the model as literal text.
 *
 * The refresh itself is one `/reload-plugins` per child (see reload.server.ts);
 * this module only decides WHEN. That is deliberately a filesystem signal
 * rather than a poll: the alternative re-runs `omp skill list` on a timer for
 * every workspace, spawning a process per tick to answer a question that only
 * changes when a file does.
 *
 * Roots watched come from `discovery-roots.ts` — ONE table shared with
 * `locateCommandFile`, because the two were written separately and this copy
 * was short by every root but the omp-native pair, so a skill added to
 * `.claude/skills`, `.codex/skills`, `.opencode/skills`, `.agents/skills` or
 * `.github/skills` in a live session was never noticed. It is applied to the
 * user scope, to every registered workspace, and to every LIVE session's cwd —
 * a session can run outside every registered workspace (a folder opened
 * straight from the sidebar, the app root) and omp still resolves project
 * skills from that directory.
 *
 * `fs.watch` with `recursive: true` costs no descriptors on macOS/Bun (measured
 * with the repo's own `countOpenFileDescriptors`: zero delta for three
 * recursive watchers over 42 entries), so the descriptor cliff this project
 * guards against is not a factor here.
 *
 * A root that does not exist yet is NOT created — the chamber must not write
 * `.omp/skills` into a user's repository just to watch it. Instead the nearest
 * existing ancestor is watched without recursion, and the real root is picked
 * up the moment it appears. That is what makes the very first skill a workspace
 * ever gets visible without a restart.
 *
 * The root list and the reload are injected, so the decision layer is testable
 * without patching modules: `createDiscoveryRootsWatch` builds an independent
 * instance, and the module-level `sync`/`stop` below drive the one the server
 * uses.
