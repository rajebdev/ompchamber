 * The discovery watcher's decisions: which directories it holds a watcher for,
 * and when it reports a change.
 *
 * The reload itself is `reloadLiveSessions` (covered separately). What these
 * tests pin is that a filesystem change under a watched root reaches the
 * callback — the behaviour a hand-written SKILL.md needs and a chamber-only
 * write path cannot provide — plus the three reconcile rules: a root that does
 * not exist yet is bridged, a root added later is picked up, and re-syncing
 * never doubles a watcher.
 *
 * The root list and the callback are injected, so no real `~/.omp`, workspace,
 * or module registry is touched.

 * coalesces a burst. The retry is what makes the test deterministic — a
 * recursive `fs.watch` is registered asynchronously, so under a loaded suite a
 * single write can land before the OS starts reporting for that directory and
 * be lost, which is a property of the test's timing rather than of the module.
 * 400 ms exceeds the module's 250 ms debounce, so a re-issue can never keep
