/**
 * Read-modify-write of an omp YAML config file: an exclusive chamber lock, a
 * comment-preserving document model, an external-change retry, and an atomic
 * write that keeps the file's mode and symlink.
 *
 * Why the `yaml` document model rather than `Bun.YAML` (plain objects):
 *
 * - **Comments survive.** `~/.omp/agent/models.yml` is a hand-authored file —
 *   its providers carry notes and per-model annotations. `Bun.YAML.parse` +
 *   `stringify` discards every comment; a single model fetch would delete them.
 * - **Byte-stable round-trips.** Serializing the live `models.yml` through the
 *   document model reproduces the file exactly (23210 bytes in, 23210 out).
 *   `Bun.YAML.stringify(doc, null, 2)` rewrites it in a different style — and,
 *   worse, emits `key: ` headers with a trailing space, which is not omp's own
 *   canonical form (`stringifyYamlConfig` strips that space).
 *
 * `Bun.YAML` remains the *parser* for read-only probes, where comments and
 * formatting are irrelevant.
 *
 * Concurrency: omp serializes its own config writes with an OS-level `flock(2)`
 * on `${path}.lock`. That lock is not reachable from Bun (no `flock` binding,
 * and the lock file omp creates must not be deleted out from under it), so the
 * chamber takes its OWN lock file and closes the remaining window with the
 * external-change check below: if the file moved between the read and the
 * write, the edit is replayed against the fresh content instead of clobbering
 * whatever omp just wrote.
