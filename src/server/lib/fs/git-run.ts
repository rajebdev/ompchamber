/**
 * `git` as ARGV, plus the path guard the mutating actions need.
 *
 * The Source Control panel's actions used to build shell strings —
 * `git add "${file}"`, `git commit -m "${message}"` — and both operands are
 * user-controlled. A repository is free to hold a file called
 * `evil$(touch /tmp/pwn).txt`, and a commit message is free to hold backticks
 * or a `$( )`: `sh -c` expands them. Measured against the previous runner, a
 * commit message of ``fix `touch /tmp/PWN` thing`` created the file and
 * committed `fix  thing`. The same shape silently broke the actions a reader
 * would call normal: a filename holding a double quote made `git add` exit 2
 * with `unexpected EOF while looking for matching '"'`, and the revert path
 * read that failure as "the file is untracked" and deleted it.
 *
 * Passing every operand as its own argv element removes the shell from the
 * picture entirely — the rule `lib/wiki/git.ts` already follows, for the same
 * reason.
 *
 * `resolveRepoPath` is the second half: `git` runs with a cwd, so a relative
 * path is bounded by git itself — but the untracked-file branch REMOVES what
 * the path names, and `path.join(targetDir, '../../x')` escapes the working
 * tree. Nothing that reaches the filesystem may be built from a client string
 * without this check.
