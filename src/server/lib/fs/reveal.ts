/**
 * Open a directory in the platform's file manager — the "Go to Explorer"
 * action behind a workspace folder's menu.
 *
 * Two properties the previous implementation (a `sh -c` string with the path
 * interpolated into double quotes) did not have, and both are the point:
 *
 * 1. **argv, never a shell string.** A workspace path is user-chosen and may
 *    contain a quote, a `$`, or a backtick; interpolating it into a command
 *    line lets it close the quoting and run whatever follows. Passing it as an
 *    argv element means there is no shell to escape at all.
 *
 * 2. **A real verdict.** The old call was fire-and-forget — it returned
 *    `{success: true}` while the opener exited 1 with "does not exist" on
 *    stderr, so the menu looked like it worked and nothing opened. This waits
 *    for the opener and reports what it said.
