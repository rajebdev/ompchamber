/**
 * Atomic file write: a sibling temp file is fully written, then renamed over
 * the target. rename(2) is atomic on POSIX, so a crash mid-write leaves either
 * the old file or the new one — never a truncated file. The temp file is
 * removed (best-effort) when the write or rename fails.
 *
 * Two properties the plain rename does NOT give you, and both are required for
 * omp's config files:
 *
 * - **Mode.** `Bun.write` creates the temp file with the process umask
 *   (0644/0664), so overwriting a `0600` file — omp opens its own config temp
 *   with `wx, 0o600` — silently loosened the mode of a file holding plaintext
 *   API keys. The existing target's mode is carried onto the replacement; only
 *   a brand-new file uses `createMode`.
 * - **Symlinks.** Renaming onto a symlinked path replaces the symlink with a
 *   regular file. omp resolves the symlink chain and writes to the real target
 *   (`Settings.#resolveYamlWritePath`), so a user who links `config.yml` into a
 *   dotfiles repo keeps the link. The chain is resolved before the temp file is
 *   placed, so the temp lands beside the real target on the same filesystem.
