/**
 * The `rg` behind the Search panel — a native one when the machine has it.
 *
 * The `ripgrep` package is a WASI build (732 KiB of wasm) whose guest sees a
 * single preopened directory. That costs two things. Speed: measured 86–117 ms
 * against 37 ms for the same query in this repo. And correctness: the guest
 * cannot reach the user's global gitignore, so a path git refuses to track —
 * `~/.gitignore` excludes `AGENTS.md` on this machine — was listed as a search
 * hit while the Files and Git panels both hid it.
 *
 * A native `rg` on PATH answers both, but `Bun.which` alone is not enough to
 * find one: the first `rg` on PATH in this repo is `node_modules/.bin/rg`, the
 * WASI shim itself (`#!/usr/bin/env node`). Resolving by hand lets a script be
 * skipped and the next PATH entry considered. When no native binary exists the
 * WASI build still runs, because the panel has to work on a machine that never
 * installed ripgrep.
