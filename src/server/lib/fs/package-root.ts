/**
 * Where the running OMPChamber package lives, and where its dependencies live.
 *
 * Two questions, deliberately separate, because the install shapes put them in
 * different directories:
 *
 * - `packageRoot()` — the first directory that holds `node_modules`, i.e. where
 *   the DEPENDENCIES are. A source checkout and a non-hoisted install answer
 *   their own root; a hoisted install answers the PARENT of the package, since
 *   a package under `node_modules/ompchamber/` has no `node_modules` of its own.
 * - `packageDir()` — the first directory that holds `src/`, i.e. where the
 *   PACKAGE's own files are (`package.json`, `public/`, `dist/client/`, the
 *   source stylesheets). In a hoisted install this is one level BELOW
 *   `packageRoot()`.
 *
 * Both walk up from the running module rather than counting `..` segments. The
 * bundle flattens every server module into `dist/client/index.js`, so a fixed
 * depth is wrong the moment the layout differs from the one it was written for:
 * four `..` from `dist/client` lands on `~/.bun/install/global`, a directory
 * that holds a `package.json` belonging to the GLOBAL INSTALL ROOT — not to
 * OMPChamber. Reading the installed version there returned `null`, the update
 * check reported no update, and the self-update classified the copy as
 * "unmanaged" and refused to replace it. Walking up finds the real package in
 * every layout instead.
