/**
 * Git-ignore resolution for the Files panel.
 *
 * `git check-ignore` is the only authority that evaluates every rule source in
 * one pass — per-directory `.gitignore`, `.git/info/exclude`, and the global
 * `core.excludesFile` (`~/.gitignore`) — so the panel dims exactly what git
 * would refuse to track. Paths are fed NUL-separated over stdin (`--stdin -z`)
 * so a directory listing of any size cannot overflow argv, and the verbatim
 * NUL-separated reply maps straight back onto those same paths.
 *
 * Paths must be relative to `dir` and must exist on disk: git resolves
 * directory-only patterns (`build/`) by stat-ing the path.
 *
 * Answers are memoized per path: the panel asks again every time a folder is
 * re-listed or re-expanded, and each question costs a `git` subprocess
 * (measured 5.6 ms). The TTL is short because a `.gitignore` the user just
 * edited should take effect without a reload; a path whose answer is still
 * cached is simply not asked about, so a re-listing of a known folder spawns
 * nothing at all.
