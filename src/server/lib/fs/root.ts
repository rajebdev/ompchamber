/**
 * Server-side helper for resolving the "scoped root" the right-panel developer
 * tools (Files / Search / Git / Terminal) operate on.
 *
 * A session row belongs to a workspace folder; when that folder is bound to an
 * oh-my-pi project (project_path), selecting one of its sessions should make
 * every right panel work inside that real project directory instead of the
 * ompchamber app directory. This module keeps that opt-in capability safe:
 * arbitrary client paths are rejected — a root is only honored when it is the
 * app root, a directory below it, or an exact registered workspace project
 * path from the SQLite database.
