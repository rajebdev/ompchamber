/**
 * Cross-process lock for read-modify-write cycles on shared config files.
 *
 * Two writers (the dev server, the installed app, or two provider mutations
 * landing together) editing the same file would otherwise silently lose the
 * earlier mutation when the later rename wins. A lockfile with exclusive
 * create (`wx`) is atomic on every platform; the holder writes its PID and
 * deletes the file on completion. Stale locks (writer crashed) are broken
 * after a grace period.
 *
 * This is deliberately NOT omp's own lock: omp takes an OS-level `flock(2)` on
 * `${path}.lock` (Linux uses abstract Unix sockets, Windows named mutexes), so
 * the two mechanisms do not interop. The window this leaves — a chamber write
 * landing between omp's read and its rename — is bounded by keeping every
 * critical section to a single read-modify-write, and omp re-reads inside its
 * own lock before applying its pending changes.
