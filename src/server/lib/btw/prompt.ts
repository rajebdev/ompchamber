/**
 * The side-question prompt.
 *
 * Byte-for-byte omp's own `/btw` template
 * (`packages/coding-agent/src/prompts/system/btw-user.md`), including
 * "NEVER use tools": the side child runs with `--no-tools`, so a tool call is
 * impossible and the prompt must not invite one. Keeping the template identical
 * means a side question reads the same in both clients and a model tuned against
 * one behaves the same in the other.
 *
 * The parent session's history is NOT part of this text: the side session
 * resumes the parent's transcript, so the context arrives as real provider
 * messages and keeps the parent's prompt-cache prefix.
