/**
 * Spawn arguments for a topic's side child.
 *
 * The side child is an ordinary `omp --mode rpc-ui` that resumes the topic's
 * transcript, run with `--no-tools`: a side question answers from the context it
 * already has and never executes a tool. That is omp's own rule — its TUI `/btw`
 * runs the side turn through `runEphemeralTurn`, which attaches the tool catalog
 * only to keep the prompt cache warm, tells the model in a system reminder that
 * tools are NOT available, and discards any tool call the model emits anyway
 * (`agent-session.ts`).
 *
 * `--no-tools` reaches the same end state from the CLI: the tool catalog is
 * omitted entirely, so a hallucinated call cannot execute and no approval gate
 * can park the turn. `--approval-mode` therefore has nothing to govern and is
 * not passed.
 *
 * `--no-title` stays: auto-titling would spend a model call on a transcript
 * nobody lists in the sidebar.
