/**
 * Why the shell's bundle failed, in the terms the person who broke it needs.
 *
 * Bun renders an HTML route by bundling it. When the bundle fails, the route
 * answers with Bun's own "Build Failed" page, which holds the file, line,
 * message and offending source line — but only inside a JavaScript payload the
 * page decodes at runtime (`Uint8Array.from(atob(…))`, a private binary format
 * with no server-side reader). Scraping that would be a bet on Bun's internals.
 *
 * `Bun.build` is the supported way to the same facts: a probe over the same
 * entrypoint with the same plugins returns `logs` carrying `message` and
 * `position {file,line,column,lineText}`. What it reports is what `Bun.build`
 * rejects, and that set covers every shape the route 500s on — measured against
 * the route on Bun 1.4.2, an unresolved import that survives tree shaking and a
 * syntax error both fail the route and are both reported here. It is not a
 * subset of the route's failures, and deliberately so: a missing named export is
 * answered `200` by the route while Bun serves a 104-byte stub that only calls
 * `location.reload()` in place of the bundle, so the page cannot run. That is a
 * real failure of the bundle and is reported as one.
 *
 * `target: 'browser'` because that is the bundle the page is served; `bun`
 * agreed with it on every case measured.
 *
 * Runs only after the shell has already failed, so its cost lands on a page that
 * is broken anyway and never on a healthy request.
