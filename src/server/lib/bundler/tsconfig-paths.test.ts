/**
 * Every `@ompchamber/*` subpath imported in this repo must have a `tsconfig.json`
 * `paths` entry.
 *
 * `paths` is not decoration here: it is what resolves a bare specifier when the
 * workspace symlink is not there. The two mechanisms are separate, and the gap
 * between them is silent until it is not:
 *
 * - a specifier WITH a `paths` entry resolves through the mapping, whatever is
 *   installed;
 * - a specifier WITHOUT one falls back to `node_modules`, which in a checkout is
 *   a `bun install` symlink into `packages/`.
 *
 * Adding the `./app` subpath to the SDK therefore did not break anything on the
 * machine that wrote it — the symlink was present and the package's own `exports`
 * map answered. It broke every tree whose `node_modules` predates that export:
 * `bun run build` and, worse, the dev server, which answers `500` on the shell
 * route with `Could not resolve: "@ompchamber/plugin-sdk/app"` and a suggestion
 * to run `bun install`.
 *
 * The rule is deliberately "imported anywhere in the repo", not "imported by
 * src": a plugin's `src/app.tsx` is compiled by the chamber's bundler with the
 * same resolution, and the tsconfig's `include` covers it for the same reason.
 *
 * Type-only imports are NOT exempt. `paths` is what `tsc` uses too, so a missing
 * entry fails the type check as well — and unlike the bundler case, a type-only
 * subpath has no `exports` fallback to hide behind.
