/**
 * Hoist every nested at-rule out of the style rule that contains it.
 *
 * Bun's CSS minifier keeps the nesting it is handed, and for a target that is
 * not the browser (`target: 'bun'`, which this build needs because its
 * entrypoint is the SERVER) it re-nests a rule's nested at-rule into
 * `@supports (…) { & { … } }`. Chrome does not apply a nested rule whose parent
 * selector names a pseudo-element, so `&` under `::placeholder` or
 * `::-webkit-scrollbar-thumb` is dropped and the rule's earlier fallback
 * declaration wins instead — measured on the built bundle: the composer
 * placeholder painted at full ink rather than 40%, every scrollbar thumb opaque
 * rather than 20%.
 *
 * Tailwind v4 emits its colour fallbacks in exactly that shape (`color:
 * var(--x); @supports (color: color-mix(…)) { color: color-mix(…) }`), so one
 * minifier decision reached 16 rules: every placeholder utility in the app and
 * every scrollbar rule, base and xterm included. The rsbuild pipeline this
 * replaced compiled for browsers and flattened the nesting itself.
 *
 * Flattening here is what makes the bundle immune: the emitted CSS is
 * `@supports (…) { .sel::placeholder { … } }` at the top level, which no
 * minifier has anything left to re-nest and every browser applies. Declaration
 * order is preserved exactly — a rule's declarations stay in the segments they
 * were written in, and each at-rule is hoisted to the position it occupied — so
 * the cascade is unchanged.
