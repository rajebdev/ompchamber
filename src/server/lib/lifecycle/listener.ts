 * The HTTP listener this process is serving on, plus how to talk to it.

 * Two consumers need it and neither can import it: the shell renderer, which
 * asks the listener for its own `/_shell` route (Bun renders an HTML route only
 * while serving), and the dev asset proxy, which asks it for the assets Bun's
 * own routing table owns. The reference is injected rather than imported because
 * `index.ts` owns the listener and imports both of them — a direct import would
 * be a cycle.
 *
 * The fetch options are part of the reference because the two are only correct
 * together. Under TLS the listener's own URL is `https://` with a self-signed
 * certificate, so an internal request without `rejectUnauthorized: false` fails
 * its handshake — measured: the shell route answered "self signed certificate"
 * and every page rendered the "Shell not available" page.
