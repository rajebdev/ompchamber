/**
 * Port guarding for a starting OMPChamber server.
 *
 * One port is served by exactly one process, and **a starting instance never
 * stops another one** — not a CLI server, not a dev run. An occupant that
 * identifies itself as OMPChamber makes the newcomer exit with the ways to pick
 * a different port; freeing a port is what `ompchamber stop --port <port>` is
 * for, done deliberately and per port.
 *
 * The refusal is load-bearing rather than defensive: a second bind is *not*
 * refused by the runtime (Elysia's Bun adapter hardcodes `reusePort: true`), so
 * two servers would coexist on one port and only the first-bound socket would
 * receive connections. The newcomer would look healthy in its own log while the
 * browser kept talking to the old build; the guard stops that state from being
 * created in the first place.
