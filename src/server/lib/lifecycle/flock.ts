/**
 * `flock(2)` through `bun:ffi`, for the port-handover lock.
 *
 * The kernel releases a flock when the holding process dies, which is exactly
 * the property a startup lock wants — no PID readback, no stale-holder
 * classification, and no polling loop to detect a dead holder. The previous
 * PID-file scheme needed all three: it wrote a PID, re-read it on every retry,
 * asked the OS whether that PID was still OMPChamber (four `sysctl` calls per
 * question on macOS), and deleted the file to release.
 *
 * `flock` is exported by `libc.dylib` / `libSystem.B.dylib` / `libc.so.6`, so it
 * is reachable the same way `lib/lifecycle/proc/darwin.ts` reaches `sysctl`.
 * Windows has no `flock`, and a host can refuse `dlopen` or answer `ENOLCK`
 * (some NFS mounts) — `flockAvailable()` is a real capability probe, and every
 * caller keeps its own fallback for the false case.
 *
 * **The lock file is never unlinked while it may be held.** Removing it is the
 * classic flock race: another process that already opened the path keeps a
 * handle on the unlinked inode and acquires it successfully while a third
 * process creates a fresh file at the same path and also succeeds. Leaving the
 * file in place makes the inode the lock, which is what flock is for; the file
 * is an empty marker, one per port.
