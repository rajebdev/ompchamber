/**
 * File-descriptor pressure, and the honest name for a spawn that dies from it.
 *
 * When the descriptor table is full, `posix_spawn` fails with a message that
 * names the shim it tried to exec — `EBADF: bad file descriptor, posix_spawn
 * '/bin/sh'` on macOS, `EMFILE: too many open files, socketpair` on Linux — and
 * says nothing about the cause. A terminal panel reads "Failed to start
 * /bin/zsh" while the real condition is that the whole server process has run
 * out of descriptors, so this module answers "how close?" and names the real
 * failure when it happens.
 *
 * A dev server reaches that state on its own, without a leak in this codebase:
 * `Bun.serve({ development: true })` holds the client module graph open, and a
 * macOS reload never releases the previous generation's (bun#40706, bun#40907 —
 * the pre-exec sweep exists only on Linux). Measured on this app: 13
 * descriptors on a freshly started server, 3354 after the first page load, and
 * never released. The ceiling it climbs toward is the kernel's own
 * (`getdtablesize()`: 61440 here), NOT Darwin's documented `OPEN_MAX` of 10240
 * — see `descriptorTableSize`, which is what makes `nearCliff` mean something.
 *
 * `countOpenFileDescriptors()` answers with `fcntl(F_GETFD)` over the table —
 * the same `bun:ffi` route `flock.ts` takes. It returns null where the symbols
 * are unavailable (and on Windows), and every caller must read null as
 * "unknown", never as "fine": `describeSpawnFailure` only names exhaustion when
 * it can see the pressure, so a genuine bad-descriptor bug still reports itself
 * plainly.
