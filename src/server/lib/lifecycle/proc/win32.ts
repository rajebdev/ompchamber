/**
 * Windows process probe.
 *
 * Deliberately the thinnest of the three, because Windows is where the other
 * two mechanisms have no equivalent:
 *
 *   - There is no `ps` and no `/proc`.
 *   - There is no zombie: a process object lives until its last handle closes,
 *     so "exited but not reaped" is not a state that can be observed. `isZombie`
 *     is therefore always false rather than a guess.
 *   - A foreign process's command line is not reachable without walking its PEB
 *     through `ntdll` while it is suspended — untestable here and far more
 *     dangerous than the problem it solves. `commandLine` returns null, which
 *     `getProcessState` already reports as `unknown`, and callers treat
 *     `unknown` as "alive but unverified" — never as confirmation.
 *
 * So identity on Windows is liveness, exactly as before this module existed;
 * the value here is that the behaviour is stated instead of emerging from a
 * `ps` snapshot that silently comes back empty.
