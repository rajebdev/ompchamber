/**
 * The bundled marketplace as a STORE.
 *
 * A plugin the package ships is an OFFER, not an install: it appears in the
 * catalog, contributes nothing to the activity bar, and is never scanned as a
 * panel. Installing it copies it into the working marketplace, where the scan
 * picks it up as an ordinary install. The two facts this file pins are the ones
 * a wrong answer hides: a store entry must not contribute a button before it is
 * installed, and once installed it must be attributed to the store so the pane
 * offers the right removal.
 *
 * Split from `registry.server.test.ts` because the two suites exercise different
 * questions — that one is the working marketplace's scan rules, this one is the
 * store list — and each needs its own fixture tree.
