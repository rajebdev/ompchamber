/**
 * Reading and writing the marketplace catalog.
 *
 * Every write is a read-modify-write of `marketplace.json`, because the file
 * carries the marketplace's own name, description and every earlier entry —
 * rewriting it from a template would drop them. Split out of the installer so
 * the two directions live together: the install appends an entry, the remove
 * drops one, and the repair drops one whose directory is already gone. They
 * share one parse and one write, which is what keeps them agreeing about the
 * shape of the file.
 *
 * The catalog and the directories are independent, and the scan relies on it:
 * a plugin present under `plugins/` and absent from the catalog still loads, and
 * a catalog entry naming a directory that is not there is reported. Nothing here
 * touches a plugin directory — deleting files is `removePanelPlugin`'s job.

 * plugin exist.
 *
 * `source` is validated against the marketplace root for the same reason the
 * catalog's own parse validates it: it arrives from a browser and is compared
 * verbatim against every entry's `source`, so an unvalidated value could address
 * an entry outside the marketplace — or, worse, be read as a path by a future
