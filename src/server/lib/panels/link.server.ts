 * Linking the chamber's own packages into a plugin's `node_modules`.
 *
 * A plugin declares `@ompchamber/*` as OPTIONAL PEER dependencies: the host
 * provides them, so the plugin must never fetch them from a registry. The
 * `optional` flag is the load-bearing half — measured on Bun 1.4.2 with the
 * package absent from the registry, `dependencies` exits 1, a plain
 * `peerDependencies` entry exits 1 with the same 404, and only
 * `peerDependenciesMeta.optional` exits 0. A plugin cloned into the marketplace
 * is built before npm is guaranteed to carry these, so without the flag the
 * install would fail outright.
 *
 * Symlinks rather than copies: the packages are developed in place, and a copy
 * taken at install time would pin a plugin to whatever the sources said that
 * day. A pre-existing entry is replaced, because a plugin that shipped its own
 * (stale) copy would otherwise shadow the chamber's.

 * at all. `Bun.resolveSync` answers both — it consults the `workspaces` map in a
 * checkout and `node_modules` in an install.
 *
 * Resolved from THIS module's directory, not the cwd: a plugin's build runs with
 * the plugin's directory as its working directory, so a cwd-relative lookup

 * There is deliberately NO Preact reconciliation here any more. An earlier
 * version pointed each LINKED package's `node_modules/preact` at the plugin's
 * copy, which is the one thing that must never happen: `packages/ui` and
 * `packages/plugin-sdk` are the HOST's own packages, so rewriting their
 * dependency tree replaced the host's Preact with the plugin's — and since the
 * runtime shim hands the host's `preact/hooks` to every plugin, a plugin that
 * declares `preact` made the host hand out the WRONG hooks instance. The
 * failure is `Cannot read properties of undefined (reading '__H')` on the first
 * render, inside the host's own UI kit.
 *
 * It is also unnecessary: the shim marks `preact` external, so the chamber's
 * bundler never resolves it through a linked package in the first place.
