/**
 * Panel-plugin state that must exist before the first request is served.
 *
 * The bundled marketplace used to be COPIED into the working directory on first
 * boot. It no longer is: the bundled plugins are a STORE the user installs
 * from (VS Code's model — an extension is not installed until you install it),
 * so copying them would install everything on day one, which is exactly the
 * behaviour this file exists to end.
 *
 * What remains is the one thing that genuinely has to happen before the
 * listener opens: the working marketplace directory and its catalog must exist,
 * because the scan reads them and a missing catalog is reported as a fault
 * rather than as an empty store.
 *
 * There is deliberately NO marker and no one-time migration. A previous install
 * left the bundled plugins copied into the working directory; those stay where
 * they are and keep working (they are ordinary installed plugins now), and the
 * user removes them from the pane if they do not want them. Deleting them on
 * upgrade would be the chamber taking a destructive action on files the user
 * may be using.
