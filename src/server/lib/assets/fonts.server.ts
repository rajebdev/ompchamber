/**
 * Font files served straight from the installed packages — plus the one the
 * chamber vendors itself (`src/shared/lib/fonts`, the Nerd Font symbols face).
 *
 * The client stylesheet reaches its `@font-face` sources through the bundler's
 * CSS loader (`lib/bundler/css.ts`), which rewrites every one of them to
 * `<FONT_ROUTE_PREFIX><basename>`. Nothing is copied at build time: a font is
 * addressed by its own basename, and this module resolves that basename back to
 * the directory that ships it.
 *
 * A directory index rather than a path built from the request, because the
 * request must never choose a directory. The index is built once, lazily, by
 * walking the vendor font directories, and a basename that is not in it is a
 * 404 rather than a lookup somewhere else.
 *
 * The search roots are not just `process.cwd()`. An installed package runs the
 * AOT bundle from `dist/client`, and a `serve --prod` started from another
 * directory has neither `node_modules` nor the source tree under it — so the
 * roots are every directory from the running module up to the filesystem root,
 * plus the cwd. Whichever one holds `node_modules` is the package root.
