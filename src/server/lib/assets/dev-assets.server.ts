/**
 * Dev asset proxy — the one place Bun's own asset routes fall short.
 *
 * In development Bun bundles `index.html` itself and answers the assets it emits
 * from its own routing table (`/_bun/client/*`, `/_bun/asset/*`), before a
 * request can reach Elysia. Those responses carry an `ETag` but ignore
 * `If-None-Match`, carry no `Cache-Control`, and are never compressed — so every
 * page load re-downloads the whole unminified bundle. Measured on Bun 1.4.2, a
 * 19.7 MB dev bundle answered `200` with all 19,755,962 bytes to a request that
 * sent its own ETag back, and again with `Accept-Encoding: gzip, br, zstd` (no
 * `content-encoding`). The same server with `development: false` answers `304`
 * and `Cache-Control: public, max-age=31536000, immutable`, which is exactly why
 * production is cheap and development was not.
 *
 * Bun's table wins for the paths it declares, so a route on `/_bun/*` cannot
 * shadow them (verified: a `routes` entry for `/_bun/client/*` is never
 * reached). The shell is therefore rewritten to a prefix this server owns, and
 * this module serves the bytes back from the listener — adding the two headers
 * Bun omits.
 *
 * Why `no-cache` rather than `immutable`: the JS bundle's name is a build
 * generation id that changes on every rebuild, but the CSS asset names are NOT
 * content-addressed — appending a rule to `tailwind.css` changed the bytes
 * served at the same `/_bun/asset/<hash>.css` URL (verified). `immutable` there
 * would pin stale styles for a year. `no-cache` plus a content `ETag` is correct
 * for both: the browser stores the body and revalidates, so an unchanged asset
 * costs one 304 instead of a re-download.
 *
 * Development only. Production assets are content-hashed and already answered
 * with a working `304` and `immutable` — by Bun's own table in runtime mode and
 * by `plugins/static.ts` from a build — so neither needs this.
