/**
 * `/fonts.css` is derived from the SOURCE stylesheets on every request, and this
 * is the gate that keeps it that way.
 *
 * The sheet used to be assembled from a directory the bundler wrote as a side
 * effect of bundling a CSS module — so it was produced once per process and
 * could never be repaired. An `rm -rf` while the server ran, or a fresh clone
 * that never built, left the route answering 0 bytes for the rest of that
 * process and the terminal's Nerd symbols face vanished: private-use glyphs
 * became tofu boxes with no error anywhere. These assertions fail if the sheet
 * ever depends on a build artifact again.
 *
 * The last case is the end-to-end one: every font basename the sheet names must
 * resolve to a file the server actually serves. A face pointing at a basename
 * no package ships is a 404 the browser swallows, which looks identical to the
 * font never having been declared.
