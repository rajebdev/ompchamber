/**
 * Conditional requests for the assets this server serves itself.

 * Two routes hand out bytes and both need the same answer to "is the client's
 * copy still good?" — `plugins/static.ts`, from a file on disk, and
 * `lib/assets/dev-assets.server.ts`, from bytes it just read back through Bun's
 * dev asset routes. They must agree: a rule applied to one and not the other
 * would make one asset kind revalidate differently from another for no reason a
 * caller could see, so the decision lives here rather than in either caller.
 *
 * The precedence is the load-bearing part. RFC 9110 §13.1.3: a recipient MUST
 * ignore `If-Modified-Since` when the request carries `If-None-Match`. So the
 * presence of `If-None-Match` settles the response on its own — a non-match
 * means "the client's copy is stale" (200), never a reason to consult the date.
 *
 * Every path here errs toward `false`. A `false` costs one full response; a
 * wrong `true` hands the client a stale asset with no way to notice.
