/**
 * `detectBusyShells` decides the terminal cap's budget, so it has to be right
 * about the two states that matter: a shell at its prompt (not counted) and a
 * shell running a command (counted). Both are observed against a real PTY,
 * because the whole question is what the *kernel* says the terminal's
 * foreground group is — a mocked probe would only test the mock.
 *
 * The probe's answer is cross-checked against `ps -o tpgid=`, which is the
 * definition of the field being read: an offset that drifted makes the probe
 * return null (its own pid guard rejects a mismatched struct) and fail these
 * assertions rather than silently report a garbage group.
 *
 * Waiting is driven by the PTY stream, not by sleeps: a shell's prompt (or the
 * marker a command prints before it parks) is the real signal that the
 * foreground group has moved, so the assertions never race a guessed delay.
