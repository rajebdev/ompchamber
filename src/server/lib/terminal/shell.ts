/**
 * Full argv for the PTY child.
 *
 * POSIX shells are launched through a one-line `/bin/sh` shim that re-acquires
 * the PTY as its controlling terminal before `exec`-ing the real shell:
 *
 *     if [ -t 0 ]; then exec <shell> -i -l </dev/fd/0 >/dev/fd/0 2>&1; fi; exec <shell> -i -l
 *
 * This is required, not cosmetic. The runtime must spawn with
 * `detached: true` — without it the child lands in the *server's* process
 * group, where a group signal would take the chamber down and `SIGWINCH`
 * cannot be addressed to the shell alone. But `setsid()` also drops the
 * controlling terminal, and a shell with no controlling tty silently disables
 * job control (`setopt monitor` fails): Ctrl+Z, `fg` and `jobs` stop working,
 * and typing while a foreground command runs goes to that command instead of
 * the shell. Re-opening the terminal as stdin/stdout restores it. Verified on
 * both macOS and Linux: with the shim `tpgid` is the shell's own pid and
 * `setopt monitor` succeeds; without it `tpgid` is -1 and Ctrl+Z is swallowed.
 *
 * Two details are load-bearing, and each was a real failure:
 *
 * - **The device is `/dev/fd/0`, not `/dev/tty`.** `/dev/tty` resolves through
 *   the child's *controlling terminal*, and a `setsid()` child has none — so on
 *   Linux the open fails with `ENXIO` ("no such device or address") even though
 *   the node exists, while on macOS the same open succeeds because Darwin
 *   tolerates it. That platform split is what took CI down: every terminal test
 *   timed out because the shim died before the shell ever started. `/dev/fd/0`
 *   is the PTY the parent already wired up, so it needs no controlling terminal
 *   to resolve and is correct on both.
 * - **The guard is `[ -t 0 ]`**, which asks whether stdin is a terminal. The
 *   device nodes are no test at all — `/dev/tty` always exists and `/dev/fd/0`
 *   always exists — so a guard built on them takes the redirect branch on a
 *   child that has no terminal, and the failing redirect then kills the shim
 *   (dash exits 2, the shell never starts) with the fallback never reached.
 *
 * This replaces `T=$(tty 2>/dev/null); … <"$T" >"$T"`, which paid a whole
 * `/usr/bin/tty` subprocess per terminal to learn a path the kernel already
 * resolves. Measured to spawn: 5.37 ms -> 3.32 ms on macOS.
 *
 * `exec` keeps the pid, so the shell stays the session leader and group kill
 * still reaches everything it starts. If stdin is not a terminal the shell runs
 * unredirected — stdio is already wired to whatever the parent gave it, only
 * job control is lost.
