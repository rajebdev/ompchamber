/**
 * Is a shell busy, or sitting at its prompt?
 *
 * The PTY's foreground process group answers this exactly, and the kernel keeps
 * it up to date: when a command runs in the foreground the terminal's `tpgid`
 * becomes that command's group, and when the shell regains control `tpgid`
 * returns to the shell's own pid. Verified on macOS against a real PTY —
 * `sleep 30` moved `tpgid` off the shell's pid, `Ctrl+C` and a backgrounded job
 * both left it on the shell's pid (a background job is by definition not the
 * foreground job).
 *
 * Why it matters: the terminal cap counts *live* shells. "Live" has to mean
 * "has work in flight", otherwise a panel that was opened, restarted, or
 * switched a few times pins the budget with shells that are all idle at a
 * prompt, and the next attach is rejected with nothing actually running.
 *
 * The value comes from the platform's `ProcessProbe` — `libproc` on macOS,
 * `/proc` on Linux — which is a synchronous read of a field the kernel already
 * has, and one `ps` subprocess answered it before. Measured on 8 live shells:
 * 30 ms for the spawn against 0.07 ms for the probe. `ps` stays as the fallback
 * for the platforms with no probe (the BSDs) and for the case where a probe
 * declines to answer, so the answer never depends on the fast path working.
 *
 * Advisory either way: any failure resolves to "not busy", because refusing a
 * shell to save a slot is worse than letting one extra through.
