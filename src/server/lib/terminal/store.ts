/**
 * The terminal registry's process-wide state, anchored to `globalThis`.
 *
 * `bun run --hot` re-evaluates the terminal modules on every server-file edit,
 * while the PTY children are detached sessions that keep running. A
 * module-local `Map` would be replaced by a fresh empty one on each reload,
 * leaving the previous shells alive with nothing tracking them: unreachable from
 * the client, never counted, never reaped, still holding their slots. Anchoring
 * the state to the process keeps a reload from orphaning anything.
 *
 * The in-flight map has to live here for the same reason, one step further: a
 * reload that dropped it would let the next `attach` start a second creation
 * for an id whose first creation is still awaiting — exactly the race the map
 * exists to prevent. `sweep` survives a reload too, or every generation would
 * start its own reaper.
