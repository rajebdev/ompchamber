 * decide that a server the user started needs a credential they never set.
 *
 * The only thing persisted is the SESSION SIGNING SECRET, and it holds no
 * password. It is persisted for one reason: `bun run --hot` re-evaluates the
 * server entry on every save, so an in-memory secret would log the user out on
 * each edit — a dev loop that punishes the person using it. A file that only
 * signs cookies can be shared across restarts without ever being able to enable
 * authentication on its own.

 * random per boot, so a restart with the SAME password minted a new hash and
 * invalidated every session (measured: a token valid before a second `initAuth`
 * call was rejected after it, with the persisted secret correctly reused). The
 * stated point of persisting the secret — "a restart keeps its sessions" — was
 * therefore not delivered at all.
 *
 * argon2's own `salt` option is not an alternative (verified on Bun 1.4.2: two
 * hashes with the same salt still differ), so the derivation is scrypt, salted
 * with the SECRET and memory-hard for the same reason the verifier is. Nothing
 * is persisted: the secret comes from `auth.json` and the password from the
 * command line, so a leaked cookie plus that file is what an attacker would
 * need to brute-force against, exactly as before.
