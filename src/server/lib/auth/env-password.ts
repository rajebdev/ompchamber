/**
 * The password a server run was given, and the environment cleanup that goes
 * with it.
 *
 * Two sources, checked in order: the `--ui-password` argv flag (the CLI hashes
 * it before spawning, so the value normally arrives only when someone runs the
 * server by hand) and `OMPCHAMBER_UI_PASSWORD`.
 *
 * The environment variable is DELETED the moment it is read, before any await.
 * `Bun.env` and `process.env` are the same object, and every child this server
 * spawns inherits it — the terminal panel's PTY (`lib/terminal/shell.ts`), the
 * omp RPC child (`lib/omp/rpc/process.ts`), `git`, `rg`. Without the delete, a
 * password supplied through the environment is readable from inside the
 * chamber's own terminal (`echo $OMPCHAMBER_UI_PASSWORD`) and by any process the
 * agent runs — a worse exposure than the argv leak the flag avoids.
 *
 * There is no file fallback. A stored password would let a `bun run dev` demand
 * a credential the person running it never set, which is the behaviour this
 * module exists to remove.
