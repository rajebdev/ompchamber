/**
 * The UI-auth gate: one `onBeforeHandle` in front of every route.
 *
 * Registered on the root Elysia instance BEFORE `routes/index.ts` is mounted,
 * which is what makes it cover the whole surface at once — REST handlers, the
 * SSE streams, and the `.ws()` routes a domain plugin registers internally.
 * (Verified against Elysia 1.4.30: a hook added after `.use()` never runs, and a
 * hook added before it runs for the child's own `ws` `beforeHandle` too.)
 *
 * Two paths cannot be covered from here and are handled elsewhere:
 *
 * - `/_shell` lives in `Bun.serve`'s own routing table rather than Elysia's, so
 *   no hook sees it. It is left reachable deliberately: it serves the page
 *   skeleton and, measured, carries no bootstrap payload — the settings map is
 *   injected by the SSR route, which is gated.
 * - Static assets are exempt by necessity: the login page is the app shell, so
 *   its bundle, stylesheet and fonts must load before any credential exists.
 *
 * The config is read once and cached. A password change goes through
 * `POST /api/auth/password`, which invalidates the cache — so a change takes
 * effect on the next request without a restart.
