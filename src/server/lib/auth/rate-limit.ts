/**
 * Login throttling: a per-IP attempt budget in front of the password check.
 *
 * argon2id already makes one guess cost ~70 ms, but that only bounds the RATE of
 * guesses — it does not stop a script from running them for a week. This bounds
 * the NUMBER of failures instead: past the budget the address is locked out
 * outright, and no verification runs at all.
 *
 * State is in-memory and therefore resets when the process restarts. That is the
 * right trade for a single-user console: a persisted lockout would have to be
 * cleared by hand after a restart, and the process is only reachable at all
 * because someone chose to expose it.
 *
 * The key is the SOCKET address (`requestIP`), never `x-forwarded-for`: that
 * header is caller-supplied, so trusting it would let one client present a fresh
 * identity per attempt and walk straight through the budget. Behind a reverse
 * proxy every client shares the proxy's socket address, which throttles them
 * together — the conservative direction for a limit whose job is to fail closed.
