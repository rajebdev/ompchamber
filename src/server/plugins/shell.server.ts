/**
 * The HTML shell, rendered by Bun's own HTML pipeline.
 *
 * The shell used to be a file the bundler wrote and the server read back
 * (`dist/client/index.html`). It is now a route Bun bundles and renders: the
 * `index.html` import carries a manifest of hashed assets, and fetching the
 * shell route returns that markup with the correct script and stylesheet tags
 * for the current build — which is also what keeps the dev HMR client injected.
 *
 * The round-trip through the local listener is deliberate. Bun renders an HTML
 * route only when serving it, and there is no API to render an `HTMLBundle` in
 * process: `new Response(bundle)` yields the string "[object HTMLBundle]" and
 * `app.handle('/_shell')` answers 404, because the route lives in `Bun.serve`'s
 * own routing table rather than Elysia's (verified against Bun 1.4.2). Fetching
 * our own listener is the supported way to obtain the markup.
 *
 * The listener reference is shared with the dev asset proxy, which needs the
 * same URL to reach the routes Bun's own table owns — see `lifecycle/listener`.
